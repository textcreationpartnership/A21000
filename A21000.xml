            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe men will leaue the fortunate Iſlands, and returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Ithaque,</hi> ſet faſt like a neaſt built vpon the very top of a ſharpe ſteepie rocke. And we will not onely leaue the mire and dirte wherein we ſit faſt mortrized, rather then we would poſſeſſe and enioy moſt aſſured and euerlaſting felicitie. Now, ſome man may peraduenture ſay vnto me,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26781:13"/> I beſeech you Sir, where is that felicity which you talke of? ſhew it vnto vs, for that is it that we deſire: for what man is he that would refuſe to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and bleſſed? Alas my good friends, I know that the worde liketh you well: but without doubt yee flie from the thing it ſelfe: or at leaſt, yee follow naught elſe but the ſhadow, and leaue the bodie flying from you, and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a vaine cloude of delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the true, ſound and incomparable pleaſure. Where then is it, ſay you? ſhew vnto vs the way and tract, that we may ſpeedely take hold thereof. Shall I tell you my good friends one thing, and that is this, would it not thinke you, make you laugh to ſee a pore or ſand blinded man come vnto <hi>Pylo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> a moſt excellent counterfeitor in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and importune him to ſhew him his pictures and exquiſite paintings, or to ſee a deaffe man preſſe in to heare the ſweet muſicke and hermonie of <hi>Bayf</hi> a moſt excellent muſition, would not the firſt man ſay, vnto the ſand blinded man, go thy way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue firſt from thee that running hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which is the cauſe of the dimming
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26781:14"/> of thy ſight, &amp; vnto the other, go thou and drie vp the catarre which is the occaſion of thy deafeneſſe, and then thou that art blindiſh, ſhalt ſee our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paintings, and thou that art deaffiſh ſhalt heare our delicate and pleaſant ſongs? For, as the pleaſure of the ſences cannot be well taſted nor reliſhed, but by ſuch as haue whole and ſound bodies, no more can the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and delight of the minde, wherein reſteth our chiefe felicitie, be perceiued by any, but by ſuch, as haue cleanſed their ſoules of all ſinfull and corrupt luſts, which as filthie botches and blaines extinguiſh the vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in that part of the body wherein they are engendred. Heere then you ſee what you muſt do, if you determine to make your ſelues capable to taſte of the fruits of this euerlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I right well know, that ye are ſo brought vp, euen from your youth, in the pleaſures of your ſences, and make ſo much of them, as that you are afeard yee ſhall loſe them, without I leaue this as a pawne vnto you, which will bring vnto you farre more infinite greater pleaſure, and wherewith I will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26781:14"/> feaſt you, and quickly ſhew it you. But who is able to make men, that are no better then duſt and aſhes, to ſee the eſtate and diſpoſition of a pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſoule, whoſe action is perfectly bleſſed, and altogether heauenly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth this moſt excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation? In very deed, you preſſe me too too ſore, and craue at my hands more then I am able to do. But becauſe I am loth to diſcourage you, and make you mal-content, I wil do for you what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I am able. And I will deale with you, as the carriers about of monſters do: For, they ſet vp their pictures at the corners of the ſtreets, and hang out the portraitures of them at their owne lodgings, and when the people haue paid their money at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of the gate, then they ſhew them their naturall and liuely bodies. Now, the ſight which I inuite you to ſee, is this <hi>VViſedome,</hi> which we may rightly ſay, to be the very truth and knowledge of all things, but eſpecially of heauenly things, which is full of vnſpeakeable cleereneſſe, brightneſſe, and ſplendure, and which alſo, if we might behold face to face, and in her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26781:15"/> naturall excellencie, would rauiſh vs with her loue, and cauſe vs hate theſe baſe and earthly things, with the loue of which we are ſo farre ſotted, euen to our very deſtruction. I will heere hang vp, as it were, vpon the beaten high waies, pictures and images, ſo that if ye be diſpoſed to go right on to the gate, yee ſhall ſee both the image and the emboſting of them: which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt moſt maruellous, and when you haue paid your cuſtome, and paſſed the borders and limits of this life, you ſhal ſee that, which no tongue is able to vtter, nor eare able to heare. But to make you acknowledge at length what this is, and plainly to prick out vnto you ſome draughts hereof, I beſeech you conſider euen of the things which you ſo wonder at heere in this world, and ſo greedely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly labour for, and hunt after, and you ſhall finde, that if you go onely ſtep by ſtep on them, and follow ſtill your way, that they will at laſt bring you vnto the knowledge of that which you at this day deſire. But becauſe that in ſtead of going on them, you ſettle your ſelues, and ſit faſt down vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26781:15"/> them, you your ſelues become moſt vile and filthie by them. Now, let vs ſee a little why you thus ſatiſfie your ſences, and from whence this pleaſure and tickling delight ſpringeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you eſtabliſh the ſeat of your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicitie. Commeth this from the obiect of naturall things, that are growne vnto perfection? Are theſe the well mingled, ſorted, and ſetled colours, and the exactly obſerued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions and dimenſions, which thus pleaſe the eyes? What other thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire you in a medow, ennameled with a thouſand goodly and odoriferous floures, and ſo richly in diuerſe places, with ſundrie colours bedecked? What other thing admire you in the ſtately buildings of kings, in their Bracelets, Chaines, and other Iewels, and in the Tables of moſt excellent Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but onely this curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? Yea what other eſtimation make you of the moſt faire ſweete faces of women, with whom yee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminately burne in loue, but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall proportion, and exact diligence of nature, in the conformitie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of many things differing one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26781:16"/> from another? What other thing is the ſweetneſſe of one eſpeciall voice of a man, or the melodie of many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in conſort, but a iuſt and orderly continuation of them all together, or ſuddaine motion of many voices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a naturall rule and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the ſame? And what other thing is the moſt pleaſant and ſweete ſauour that a man can poſſiblie ſmell, but a certaine temperature both of heate and moiſture, and a certaine qualitie imprinted in a bodie, by the ſuddaine motion of one or many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Neither is any thing ſweet and pleaſant in the moſt delicate meates and ſauoures, but a certaine meaſure of well mixed licoures. Neither doth the touching of them bring or yeeld any other pleaſure, but a certaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie and length which we finde in naturall bodies. Now marke then all the pleaſures which your ſences can poſſibly receiue: yee conſume the whole time of your life, onely about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for, for them alone, ye wearie your bodies with continuall toiling &amp; moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and for them alone, yee ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the winds, and croſſe the ſeas.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26781:16"/> If then yee finde that all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things do poſſeſſe your minds by a certaine vaine ſhew of beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, what will yee then ſay, when as yee ſhall conſider of them all at once, and at one view, euen from their firſt beginning, vnto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of their perfection? Shall yee not ſee the ſelfe and the ſame difference betweene them, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one ſtone alone, and an whole proude and coſtlie Pallace, and betweene one voice, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet and full noiſe of muſick, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one finger, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die? What matter can you make of all theſe particular things, eſpecially of theſe earthly things, when as in lifting vp your eyes towards the Sunne and Starres, yee behold the world, from the higheſt part of heauen, to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the earth, euen from the beginning of the ſame vnto the end thereof, and conſider, how many wonderfull things are depainted and ſet foorth on euery ſide? If ſo be then, we haue done it to feed and ſatiſfie our ſences onely, with the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of theſe beautifull and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26781:17"/> things, it muſt needs be that we haue done it at the leaſt by reaſon of the whole workmanſhip and frame of the ſame, the elegancie whereof conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the accordance and aſſembly of all the other particular beauties &amp; ornaments thereof. But our ſoule, which lancheth and ſtretcheth forth her deſires and wiſhes farre aboue the reach of our ſences, without we will violently captiuate, choake and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her, hath no deſire to ſtay heere. For ſhe findeth nothing heere, which can any way retaine, or yet containe her. But ſhe is more honourable then ſo, for ſhe embraceth heauen and earth, compaſſeth all the whole world, pierceth the bottomleſſe depths, knoweth all things, and beſtirreth and manageth her ſelfe, and is ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that if we conſerue her in her naturall excellencie, all the reſt of the things of the world, in reſpect of her, will ſeeme to be moſt filthie and oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. After ſhe hath beheld her ſelfe, and exerciſed her ſelfe about the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out of cauſes and ſciences, finding nothing in all this, no not any thing in her ſelfe, that liketh her
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26781:17"/> ſelfe, and reſting her ſelfe in a deſire which ſhe hath to learne, ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to lift vp her ſelfe farre aboue the world, yea and farre aboue her ſelfe, and ſuffereth her ſelfe to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the workes of the worke-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And there ſhe ſeeth all at once, all ſorts of beauties and perfections, abutting and aſſembling themſelues euen from their very firſt originall, and by ſo much the more they appeare moſt excellent and wonderfull, by how much the nearer they come from thence from whence they firſt came. Altogether like vnto the Sunne beames, which, the nearer they are the bodie from whence they ſhoote and ſpred themſelues, the greater, the purer, and the brighter they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. I vſe eſpecially in this behalfe this compariſon, becauſe that of all things which we know heere below, nothing more proportionably agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with our ſoule, then our ſight, which is the moſt noble, liuely, &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt action of all our ſences, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more proportionable vnto God then the light, which is the moſt pure and moſt excellent thing in the world.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26781:18"/> And the ancient wiſe men haue ſaid, That the light was Gods bodie, and the truth his ſoule, repreſenting, ſhewing, and giuing vs a taſte as it were, heereby, of one of the greateſt ſecrets of the Godhead. We muſt therefore open and vnſeele the eyes of our minde, that we may pearſe into this heauenly light, euen vnto the depth of the euerlaſting truth. If we will neuer ſo little helpe our ſelues, and lift vp our ſoule, that ſhe may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by thoſe ſteppes, which offer themſelues vnto her, and hoiſe vp her ſaile on hie, what delight and pleaſure might ſhe not hope for, but wiſh, not wiſh for, but ſay, not ſay, but thinke, which we enioy not in full meaſure? yea ſuch pleaſure as that we ſhould feele encreaſe and redouble in vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time that being aſcended vnto the feaſt, we ſhould be ioined vnto that firſt and moſt high light. So as we then being compaſſed with brightneſſe, and rauiſhed with the ſight of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beautie, ſhould feele the pleaſure moſt infinitly to be encreaſed, &amp; be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable ioy, &amp; to make vs generally ſcorne theſe fleeting &amp; peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26781:18"/> delights, al theſe fading &amp; cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſweet pleaſures, which occupie our minds here belowe, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be deſired, then as a ſmall ſparke of beautie ſpred ouer vs like a ſcarfe. Then ſhall we enter into the ſhop where all theſe rare and ſtrange workes were caſt in a mould, where we ſhall not onely ſee the patternes of them, and not onely handle the tooles and inſtruments, but ſhall alſo ſee, and familiarly know the very workemaſter of them: who will not onely ſhew vnto vs his workemanſhip, nor deſcifer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto vs his purpoſes, but will alſo teach vs his arte and ſcience, and make vs all perfect and godly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him ſelfe. There ſhall we ſee the beames of this Deity ſpread all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and reunite it ſelfe vnto this body of light, whereunto, when we ſhall ſee our ſelues conioyned in thought, we ſhall then perceiue at once all the cauſes and effects of the eternall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which particularly, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably may ſeeme to be able to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with matter to our great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Here then we ſee wherein conſiſteth our felicitie, that is to ſay,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26781:19"/> in this vndriable ſpring-head of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in this deepe ſea of all bounties, whereinto all the riuers &amp; ſtreames of the world muſt run. That is to ſay, into this original light, vnto whom we muſt turne our ſelues, and vpon whome we muſt faſt fixe and ſet the eyes of our ſoules, if ſo be we loue the eternall bleſſedneſſe. Alas, how excellent was this laſt ſigh of the Philoſopher <hi>Plotin,</hi> who hauing now his ſoule geuing vp her ſelfe betweene his lips, called his ſchollers vnto him, giuing them this farewell. My good friends, God graunt you to liue, both now, and hereafter, in bliſſe for euer, and alwayes turne that godlineſſe that is in you, vnto that auncient &amp; principall Deitie. O noble ſpeech, and worthie the cloſing vp of the mouth and life of a Philoſopher! But what ſhall we do for the returning of our ſelues vnto God, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, reunite, and become one with him? Shall we preſent our ſelues vnto his maieſtie in that eſtate wherein we commonly ſtand? No ſurely, for if we, before ſuch time as we lift vp the eyes of our ſoules towards this cleere and bright burning light, do not wipe, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26781:19"/> cleanſe our ſelues, we ſhall, in ſtead of enioying this glorious and pure light, haue that little ſight that we haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly put out. For, as in the lawe of the Iewes, the woman that offred her ſelfe vnto the triall of the ielouſie offering, receiued no hurt by the bitter &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed water if ſhe were chaſt and ſound, but was quit and free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all blame &amp; ſuſpicion: and contrariwiſe, if ſhe had broken her mariage promiſe &amp; faith, remained infected, and ſo rotted and burſt in ſunder: euen ſo alſo thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who, as the members of the Church of God, haue maried his only Sonne, if they offer themſelues poluted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed to touch the holy fier of his holy ſpirit, are rather blinded, then enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, yea rather conſumed, then war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And this is the reaſon why God, when as he, hauing compaſſion of our ruine &amp; fall, is willing for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to diſcloſe vnto the world this light of wiſedom, he ſendeth his herault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to waſh &amp; make cleane the ſoules of all ſuch as he would haue behold the brightnes of his glory. We heare euery where the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the holy voice of this Prophet, crying, <hi>Make ſtraight &amp; plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:26781:20"/> the wayes of the liuing God, repent, and bring forth the fruites worthy of repentance, for he will come with his fanne in his hand to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now the Corne from the Chaffe, lay vp the Corne by it ſelfe, and caſt the Chaffe into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting fier.</hi> Seeing then that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this great felicitie, and that before we preſent ourſelues vnto him, we muſt cleanſe our harts and minds, and make them capable to conceiue of heauenly things, let vs ſee what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies we haue for that purpoſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, let vs ſomewhat a little before, conſider, how and in what ſort we haue ſo defiled our ſelues, that we might thereby the more eaſily finde out the meeteſt meanes to cleanſe our ſelues: and let vs ſee from whence and which way we are fallen, that thereby we may perceiue by what meanes we may be able to lift vp our ſelues againe. For, God ſaw nothing amongſt all his workes which any thing drew neare vnto his perfection: and therefore he himſelf was then deſirous to mould and faſhion a liuing image of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which ſhould be his chiefe and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall worke, and ſet him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the world. Whereupon, man
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26781:20"/> forthwith ſhewed himſelfe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the earth ſo perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, as that nothing could be wiſhed to be more excellently perfect. For, he being made a liuely image, and being alſo as it were but a ſhort and halfe picture, hauing withall, many the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments both of the aire, and of the grace of the principall ſubiect or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was moſt wonderfully perfect. The holy fier which God had breathed into him, being very pure, enlightened his vnderſtanding, and filled him with the knowledge of all things, in ſo much, that he hauing truth for his guide, and vertue for his ayde, all his actions paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within the compaſſe of reaſon: and turning him ſelfe continually vnto his Creator, receiued to himſelfe as in a very cleere looking glaſſe, the forme and faſhion of the Deitie: in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of whome, he fixed and ſtayed all his thoughts, and thereby became very bleſſed, for he liued in God, and God in him. But when as this mirror which was beautified and adorned with the obiect of the Deitie, would needs runne him ſelfe amongſt the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous ſtormes, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26781:21"/> thereby defile and ſully him ſelfe, then this immortall brightneſſe diſdained any more to ſhew himſelfe vnto him, and left him altogether to remaine in darkeneſſe &amp; obſcuritie. So that man, before ſuch time as he had turned his back vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, being filled with a moſt ſure knowledge of all things, is now as it were become brutiſhed, and in ſtead of truth, is full of error and lying: and in ſtead of a ruled and moderate will, is now full of burning luſt, ſo as all his thoughts which before were reunited to the beholding of his creator, haue now ſpread themſelues ouer the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; roame about at all adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures without either guide or reaſon. This concupiſcence and luſt then hauing thus proſtituted her ſelfe, forthwith conceiued ſin, which comming to a ful growth, amended death. And death in deed, brought forth the extremitie of al euils, and death I ſay, the hope of all horror and obſcuritie, wherein, all the while that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſwadled &amp; wrapped, was neuer ſince euer able to receiue the brightnes of the immortal light, ne yet attaine againe vnto the conduct of the truth, the only beholding wherof is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26781:21"/> able to keepe him backe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comming to the point of his felicitie. When man ſaw himſelfe thus defaced, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with himſelfe, &amp; curſed his life as a gulfe of miſerie, where he ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before his eyes but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion and darkeneſſe. And all his animaduerſions were nothing but of euils, and all his hope of nothing but of calamities. For, God being nothing but righteous, and man, nothing elſe but ſinne, what meaſure or end could there be of his puniſhment? Howbeit, the eternall wiſedome who wrought with God in the creation of man, hauing compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the loſſe &amp; deſtruction of ſuch a worke, came, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayth, to lay a ſteepe the poiſon of death in his own blood, to waſh &amp; cleanſe vs, &amp; beſides, to turne away the iuſt wrath of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he might haue mercy vpon vs, and ſo turne vnto vs againe. Thus we ſee how we are entred againe into grace with our God, purified by his mercie, called againe vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his truth, and the beholding of his glorie. Howbeit, we are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe &amp; obſtinate in our curſedneſſe, &amp; ſo great enemies to our owne felicitie,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26781:22"/> as that ſo ſoone as this eternall light would begin to appeare and ſhine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the cleareneſſe of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there to expreſſe and reimprint the face of his Deitie, and relieue and recharge the lineaments of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſedome, which are ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defiled, and as it were vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, as that we make a thouſand foule blemiſhes rebound vpon our ſelues, which blind and defile vs, and thruſt them ſelues betweene vs, and the grace which ſhould enlighten vs. We muſt therefore as often as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our ſelues, ſo often alſo lay too our hands to wipe away our foule and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſtaines, for the cleanſing and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our ſoules, ſo that we thereby being poliſhed, the beames of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall bountie and goodneſſe may cauſe the cleareneſſe of vertue and truth moſt clearely ſhine, and brightly burne vpon vs. Here then we ſee the meanes which we herein muſt hold and keepe: let vs now looke what the cauſe of this euill is, and then let vs alſo wiſely conſider of the remedie for the ſame. In very deede, our peruerſe and corrupt iudgement, is the very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26781:22"/> fountaine of all our offences, and the ſpring-head of that peſtilent humor, which ſo infecteth and ſpoyleth vs. The things which ſpoyle and trouble vs, are the delightes and pleaſures which on euery ſide alure vs, and make vs drunke before we are fully awake. This licour then being mixed amongſt our tender ſenſes, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of our age, ſo delicately ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, as that we can neuer after loſe and forget the ſauour thereof. We content not our ſelues with moderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drinking, but we will be ouer head and cares alſo, tarrying ſtill by it as if we would haue the tide ouerflowe vs, leauing our ſelues drowned as it were vpon the ſwallowing quickſand of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable old age. Now theſe ſweet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours wherewith we ſo fill and glut our ſelues, turne by and by into bitternes, and fill our harts and minds with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous humor, which infecteth and corrupteth vs. For, the affection which we beare vnto the beauty of theſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things, being entertained and flattered by vs, changeth it ſelfe into a furious and mad luſt, which peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ouerthroweth our ſenſes: for,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26781:23"/> the flattering and diſſembling deſire which we haue vnto theſe worldly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, turneth it ſelfe into a blinde and ſenſleſſe paſſion, and are none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be eſteemed in this world, but as the ordure and excrement of the earth: and the loue of falſe honor conuerteth it ſelfe into a fooliſh deſire to be farre more then the reſt of the world, and chalengeth vnto it ſelfe the reuerence and ſeruice that is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God himſelfe. The pleaſure which we take in our feeding, is turned into beaſtly and ſhameleſſe gluttony: The care that we take in preſeruing our bodies delicately, groweth into beaſtly vncleanneſſe, and filthy luſt, and the worthineſſe that we beleeue too too much of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all theſe ſubtile and mortall paſſions, and poyſons of the minde, we muſt ſee what remedie we can finde out for them, and it may be,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26781:23"/> it will be to good purpoſe to vſe the counſell which a good auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue vnto a religious nouice of his houſe. Like as wiſe nurſes (ſayd he) when they will weane their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will rub the neble of their teate with wormewood, and other bitter druggs, euen ſo muſt we be dealt withall for the making of vs loſe the taſte of our delightes and pleaſures, for wee muſt ſet downe vnto our ſelues a certaine puniſhment for our luſts, and change the houres of our pleaſures into rigorous and auſtere exerciſes, and at what time we are wonted to take our fooliſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute recreations, let vs examine with all humilitie, what paynes and torments our ſinfull and deteſtable life deſerueth. I cannot tell whether this good old Father in ſpeaking this, thought vpon the cuſtome which the Hebrewes vſed, who made a ſolemne feaſt vpon that day that they began to weane any of their children, or whether they reioyced in that their children left their weaker foode, and fell to more ſtrong and marrowye meates, either elſe to ſtirre them vp by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26781:24"/> their example vnto a new kinde of dyet. For we may verie fitlie applie this example vnto the inſtruction of our mindes, if ſo be we will weane our ſelues from the milke of our delights, and ſweare an irreconciliable diuorce betweene vs and our ſinnes, inuiting our ſelues vnto the like feaſt, as he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe holie religious men, of whome <hi>Phylo,</hi> in the booke of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue life, maketh mention, did. They met together at this banquet, and the firſt, principall and moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and ſweet diſhes, were the moſt beautifull and beſt taſting fruites of true wiſedome, which were preſented vnto them by a moſt elegant prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Prophets and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, as pure and vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led veſſels. Their reioycing, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, their paſtime, auſteritie, their delicate diſhes, abſtinence. Their mindes being ſatisfied with ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowy meate, they were in a maruelous great and firme tranquillitie, to be at leyſure to follow their moſt happie contemplation. And ſurely this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe would become vs all very well, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, we had need euery one of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26781:24"/> vs particularly to accomplish this our purging of the ſoule, which we call re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by meanes whereof, our ſoule returning into her ſelfe, ſhall be able to wipe out ſpot by ſpot, the blots that there moſt filthely do ſauour. Seeing then that this repentance ſhould be vnto vs as it were the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and preface of a good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life, which ſhould make vs cleane, we ſhould therein exerciſe our ſelues both carefully and ordinarily. For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are determined to erect a Temple in our ſoule, wherein to lodge the Deitie, we muſt therfore through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſh and rewaſh the ſame with this purifying water, and thinke that it is to vs vnto whome <hi>Ezechias</hi> ſpeaketh, when as he ſaid vnto the Leuits, <hi>Liſten vnto me, and ſanctifie your ſelues, make cleane the houſe of the Lord, and thruſt the filthineſſe out of the Sanctuarie. We will haue our Spirite to be his Aulter, our thoughtes, his offerings: our prayers, his preſents: and ſhall we offer them in a filthie place?</hi> would he not then ſay vnto vs, that which was ſpoken vnto the Iewes by the mouth of <hi>Malachy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I haue not ſet mine heart vpon you, neither will I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26781:25"/> receiue any ſacrifice from you, becauſe you are moſt filthie and full of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>llution.</hi> But how ſhall we begin to performe ſuch a glorious and profitable an action? Saint <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> teacheth vs, and geueth vnto vs an excellent inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof: We muſt (ſayth he) looke well vnto our ſelues, and hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of our miſerie, we muſt rub and make leane our hearts: ſo as we muſt alwayes haue our mouths full of the confeſſing of our ſinnes, and the reſt of our actions, in great and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar humilitie. The filthy, ſtinking, and brutiſh concupiſcences of ours, finding our hearts voyd of the grace of God, place themſelues there, and in ſuch ſort puffe vp and harden our harts, as that no goodnes can now enter them, without we firſt preſſe and ſqueeze them betweene our hands with ſharpe &amp; earneſt contrition. To be ſhort, if we ſhall not haue blowen this bladder full of wind, we ſhal neuer find this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al licour, &amp; this holy oyle of conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer to be placed there. This was the preſumption that firſt aſſaulted the Angels, and ſince that time hath ſet a ſnare or pitfall to trap our feet in.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26781:25"/> This is that thing which as an heauie counterpoiſe keepeth vs continually tied vnto theſe worldly luſts, and which ſettle our deſires in our ſelues, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs beleeue that we liue only for this world, and ſtayeth alſo the ſayle of our ſoules from lanching towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. How ſhall we then rid our ſelues out of this? Forſooth, in caſting back our eys vpon our life, in conſidering of our fouleneſſe &amp; deformitie, &amp; in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding how many miſeries &amp; afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſurprize vs, which we neuer once loked for. If the iuſtice of God, ouer-compaſſionat in our behalfe, did not ſufficiently furniſh vs with matter to be angrie with our ſelues, or if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee are too neere vnto our owne harmes, we cannot ſee them, let vs turne our eyes vpon the infinite millions of men which now are, or yet heretofore haue been, and let vs marke what a ſmall and ſhort thing their life is, and hath been, and yet although it bee neuer ſo ſmall and ſhort, yet it is enuironed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſorrowes, griefes, and cares, which are the verie fruites of theyr ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. Do not all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26781:26"/> men liuing continually cry and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of their miſeries and miſhaps? Now, it is no reaſon that we moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and filthie wretches that we are, ſhould ſeeke out of our ſelues the mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er for which we ſhould be angrie and grieued with our ſelues. For, our conſciences do commonly tell vs, and continually repreſent vnto vs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of vs, the regiſter of our ſinnes: agreeing with that of <hi>Democritus</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That hee heard the voyce of malice and ſinne accuſing her ſelfe. Ouer and beſides all this, the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtice, or the fatherly care of God, continually ſheweth vnto vs his rods, ſometimes ſtriking vs with them, to make vs awake, and leape out of this miſerable, filthie, and dirtie puddle. But if nothing will cauſe vs to hate our ſelues, and deteſt our miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life, let vs conſider with our ſelues, and thinke of this hideous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible image of death, vnto whome our ſinne hath deliuered vs vp. For, death followeth vs hard at our heeles both by ſea and land, he embarketh himſelf with vs, and rideth on horſebacke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde vs, and leaueth vs nothing ſaue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26781:26"/> only our ſhadow. We do nothing elſe all our life long but flye from him, and yet we are ſtill neerer and neerer him. It is he that in a moment cutteth off the thread of our deſires, and he, who vppon the ſuddaine, bereaueth vs of all that we haue ſcraped together with great paine, and in the end ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our ſelues away cleane out of the world. Seeing then that his image is pictured out to be ſo feareful in all the corners of our life, let it be a bridle to reſtraine our filthy luſts, and let vs ſtep backe when we ſee ſuch a bottomleſſe deapth lye wide open before vs. But if we haue ſo engaged and bound our ſelues before hand, as that we cannot goe backe, yet he at leaſt forewarneth vs of the danger, and let vs forſake this vile and heauie burden of baggage, that we may the lightlier leape, and luſtelier skip ouer this dangerous breake-necke, and leape into that goodly and flouriſhing playne, which we ſee to be on the other ſide, which is that euerlaſting life that we all waite for. Howbeit, if the remembrance of this temporall and corporall death cannot poſſibly wither and dry vp our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26781:27"/> thoughts, who is he amongſt vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhall but once think vpon the other death which afterward threatneth vs, which is this ſpiritual &amp; eternal death, that wil not tremble &amp; gnaſh his teeth with feare? yea a moſt horrible death, becauſe that they vpon whom it layeth hold, do dye eternally, not looking for the bleſſednes whereof they depriued themſelues for euer, and yet liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but altogether in ſorrowes &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereunto they are eternally reſerued. Alas, are not we able ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly &amp; horribly to picture him out, as that we neuer dare once behold his looks? Let vs picture the dart which he carieth in his hand, with fire and flame round about it, and arme it with hell fire, &amp; with fireforks and tongs. But we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe garniſh him with al maner of orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to make him ſeeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto our eyes, &amp; ſet a falſe couler vpon him, to make him ſhew more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable vnto our liking, we erect aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto him, &amp; neuer make feaſts of reioycing, but when as we conſecrate our ſoules vnto him. And when is that? forſooth euen then, when we bath our ſelues in theſe worldly pleaſures, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26781:27"/> when we plunge our ſoules into that infernall riuer of forgetfulneſſe, which putteth out that heauenly fier that is in vs, rocketh vs aſleepe, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs become moſt brutiſh &amp; beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we then ſay that we liue, not counting any of thoſe dayes any part of our life, which we paſſe not ouer in paſtimes &amp; merime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, nay rather which we paſſe not ouer in, ſins &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Surely we are much like vnto thoſe ſailers which turn their backs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where they meane to go aſhore. We make a ſhew as thogh we would eſchue this death, &amp; yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of our liues, we run vnto it with open mouth. Let vs therefore looke wiſhly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this death, and on as many other rocks as we muſt ſayle and flote by in this voyage, that we may feare. And let vs conſider, that we are now ſo wounded and bruſed, as that if an eſpeciall fauour from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſaue vs not, we ſhall be hardly able to auoyd ſhipwracke. This is the contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhould be in our ſouls, &amp; this is that bitter repentance which ſhoulde drawe bloudie teares euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the bottome of our bowels.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26781:28"/> This is it that ſhould make vs hate euen our own ſelues for the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciling of vs vnto our God, &amp; to renue our life of ſin and wickednes, into puritie and cleanneſſe. This is it that ſhould cauſe vs to enter into iudgement with our ſelues, that we might not be reſerued vnto the day of that moſt heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For what man is he that is able at that day to iuſtifie himſelfe? Now, it is not enough that we haue had this compunction and repentance in our harts, but we muſt alſo lay open our ſinnes, and the iuſtice of God, that we might receiue from him his mercy and comfort. And it is he that muſt accept of our ſorrow and griefe, and he, vnto whome we muſt make an honorable amends, and ſimply and plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our errors. For, ſeeing it is his pleaſure, that his goodnes which he is able to keepe and reſerue vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhould be poured out vpon all his creatures, and that he hath made all things to manifeſt his glorie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the vſe of our life only to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, neither are we any way able to repare the offence which we commit againſt him, by the corrupting of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26781:28"/> vſe of our life, but in manifeſting that he hath created vs to do good, &amp; that we our ſelues haue conuerted our ſelues only to do ill. And therefore we muſt of neceſſitie vndoubtedly declare that he is liberall, &amp; we moſt vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, we muſt ſay, that he is good, &amp; our ſelues to be moſt wicked, we muſt alſo pronounce his righteouſneſſe, and our ſinne, we muſt ſet forth our own griefs and his mercy, we muſt proteſt that all the euill which is in vs, commeth of ourſelues, and all the good which we hope after, to proceed from him alone. For, if ſo be we ſhall be ſilent, after that we haue once acknowledged our euill, it is to be belieued that we will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere with this ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all the daies of our life paſt, and ſo approue by this ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that we cannot freely be found fault withall. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> exhorting vs vnto this confeſſion, telleth vs, that we do not confeſſe our ſelues vnto God, as if he knew not our ſinnes before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but becauſe confeſſion is a counſel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſatisfaction, and maketh vs apt vnto reconciliation, and reconciliation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mercy, and mercy vnto euerlaſting life. Now, the ſatisfaction which we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26781:29"/> looke for, commeth from his fauour and grace, by which only we muſt, and may be reſtored vnto immortalitie, and this grace is not geuen vnto any, but vnto ſuch as acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be miſerable ſinners, and not geuen by any, but by him that is chiefe in power. It muſt needs therefore be, that the word which he hath beſtowed vpon vs to glorifie him withall, muſt be employed to the manifeſtation of our miſery, becauſe the confeſſion of our ſinnes, iuſtifieth the goodnes of God, which we haue as much as in vs lieth vtterly peruerted. We muſt therefore pray vnto him to forgiue vs, as if we ſhould ſay, that he may and ought to puniſh vs, and ſo thereby teſtifie his power and righteouſnes. For this cauſe it is why the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth vs, when as he ſayth, <hi>Goe your wayes with thoſe that are ſanctified, and preſent your Confeſſion vnto God with the liuing. O</hi> ſayth <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, it is a good thing when as he that is ſound in a fault will manifeſt his repentance.</hi> And truly it were a great glorie for vs, if we would be once ſo couragious as openly to confeſſe our ſinnes, and ſhew that as we haue been
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26781:29"/> the firſt that haue ſinned, ſo alſo we are the firſt that do repent. Howbeit, there remaineth in vs a fooliſh ſhame, which abideth with vs as the skarre of ſinne, and cauſeth vs the ſlowlier and hardlier to do it. This was the cauſe why the auntient Fathers in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues vnto this our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and vnto the weakeneſſe of ſuch alſo which might be offended in the reciting ſometimes of very ſtrange ſinnes of ours, were contented that we ſhould put downe and poure out the ſecrets of our conſciences into the boſoms of thoſe vnto whome they had geuen power to binde and loſe, and apply vnto vs the grace by which we are redeemed. And from this miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie we receiue a maruelous fruite, when as it is worthely adminiſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. For firſt, he that is appointed to the diſpenſation of this grace, being made vnto vs the father of the ſpirit, is to bring the ſame vnto vs for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the miſtery which he findeth in vs by the trial of our life, euen the very ſelfe ſame affection which a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the behalfe of his very ſick ſon, vnto whom he bringeth beſides help &amp;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:26781:30"/> remedy, the hope of health, wherewith he feedeth him. For he ſhould in the fellow feeling of our miſery, and taking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the burden of our ſins, help to relieue vs, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we faint in the middeſt of our courſe. This example which God hath ſet before vs, who (as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayth) came himſelfe firſt, <hi>and hath layd vpon his owne backe all our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and borne vpon his ſhoulders all our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</hi> After he hath thus imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs this comfort, he is to direct vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of truth, and with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the word of God, wherin he is exerciſed, to till the faith which he hath ſowed in vs, which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y reaſon of the barrenneſſe of the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is caſt, had always neede to haue the help and care of the husbandman. For we are properly like vnto a ſmall Boate, which is forcibly rowed with ores againſt the ſtreame: but if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen neuer ſo litle leaue rowing, ſhe fleeteth back more in an hour, then ſhe did in a whole dayes rowing. The end and conſummation of this holy action is this, that when we call vpon the holy Ghoſt, our grace is pronounced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and confirmed as it were by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26781:30"/> the iudgement of the church, which is a certaine pawne and teſtimonie, that as we are heere in this world kept fine and cleane by him or them vpon whom ſuch graces are beſtowed, ſo ſhould we alſo be in the other, by him, vpon whom he hath appointed them. There reſteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing after this, but that we humble our ſelues in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace which we haue receiued, a thing that we hardly can obtaine at our own hands. Now we will not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſtick to admire at this, but we will neuer follow the example of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which at that time vſed this holy repentance. Yet ſhould haue ſeene of theſe men, ſaith this <hi>Tertullian,</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the feete of the Aulters, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſackcloth and aſhes, bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bitterly their ſinnes, and wringing the mercie of God from him. But theſe are remedies which we neuer ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but by maine compulſion: for the ſhame which we haue of dooing theſe good things, rebateth and ſtrangleth whatſoeuer good thing we are any way forward in. And it is great pittie, that that which neither the voice of the holy Ghoſt, the counſell of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26781:31"/> nor the example of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is able to draw vs vnto, the wrath and vengeance of God will bring vs vnto, manger our heads. In very deed we put on ſackcloth, but we do it when we can no longer tarrie: we caſt aſhes on our heads, but we do it hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, before ſuch time as the wrath of God commeth, which findeth vs out. And we creepe and lowte vnder the Aulters, but it is becauſe we would flie from his hand that purſueth vs. O rebellious and curſed ſeruants that we are! for we neuer reuerence our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes. And therfore we muſt ſo humble our ſelues before him, as that we thruſt not from vs, by vaine &amp; preſumptuous thoughts, the grace, by which we are cleanſed and purified. Now, when we ſhall haue thus gathered as it were into our hands the ſinnes, which are the briars and brambles of our ſoules, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the field of our conſciences with teares, and ſoftened and made them tender by this manner of dealing, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26781:31"/> driuen away the cloudes which did ſo ouer-ſhadow vs, and that the Sunne of the grace of God, ſhall begin to ſhine vpon vs and warme vs, we muſt then heerevpon ſowe ſuch ſeed as may in the end bring forth for his fruite, an heauenly and immortall life. And this ſeed is our will, which as it bloometh either well or ill, euen ſo bringeth it forth either good or bad deedes. Now this argueth well with the meaning of <hi>Theages</hi> the Pythagoriſt: for he ſaith; That this will was as it were the hand of our ſoule, wherewith ſhe turneth all things either vnto good or ill: which is the very ſelfe ſame that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs; <hi>That God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning made man, and left him in the hand of his owne counſell, he ſet fier and water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that he might beare them in which hand he would:</hi> Which was the thing that might addreſſe this will vnto good, and this is the ſound reaſon, which is the rule that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things vnto that end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto God hath created them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man might the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, that it was eaſier for him to doo good, then to doo ill, and that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26781:32"/> he hung not alwaies vpon any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full determination, and beſides the naturall light, which he had giuen vnto him, he gaue him alſo his law to preſerue him, if he would keepe it, and to as many of vs as liue in his faith. And beſides his law and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs his grace, which ſo long as we keepe it, maketh vs to do nothing but that which agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his commandements, and conſequently with all good reaſon. Now, this rule of well dooing, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in ſharpe witted propoſitions, full of ſubtiltie and ſophiſticall defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and concluſions: for the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of which, a man had need to haue a whole world. For all this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſteth in theſe two points, <hi>To loue God with all thine heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> And yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for the making of the way more plaine, and to lead vs as it were by the hand into our workes, we haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine precepts to examine, and put to euery of them, by our actions, and to finde the meanes, wherein the comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that which we would do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtieth. This goodly ſeemlineſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26781:32"/> diſpoſition of the minde, being there placed, we call vertue. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe changeth and taketh her particular name according to euery action wherein ſhe ſheweth her ſelfe, it ſhall ſerue to good purpoſe, as I thinke, for the matter that we haue in hand, to ſalute by the way as we paſſe, the eſpeciall ſorts, out of which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth her ſelfe ofteneſt vnto our ſight. The Philoſophers beganne to teach, that vertue was a perſwading to greatneſſe of courage, and an embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening vnto generoſitie &amp; valure. But my deſire is to follow the diſcipline of thoſe whoſe liues and conuerſations, I would gladly follow. <hi>Philo</hi> the Iewe, ſpeaking of the religious men diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed throughout the deſerts of Egipt, and who in great perfection of life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed their time in contemplation, ſaith; That they laid vp in their ſoules <hi>Temperance,</hi> as a good, firme, and ſure foundation, whereon they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſettle and eſtabliſh all manner of vertues: and therefore we muſt begin at that end. For, if <hi>Plato</hi> with ſome reaſon compareth our ſoules vnto hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which muſt be ridden and broken

We call this temperance, the authoritie and power which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaſon ought to haue vpon the luſts and violent affections which carrie our will vnto pleaſures and delights. This then muſt be the reine as it were vnto our ſoules, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerue vs as a fit inſtrument, to ſcum the boiling deſires which ariſe in our ſoules, by reaſon of the heat of bloud, that they might be alwaies ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and egalled vnto reaſon, wher vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they muſt be proportionable, not regarding nor yeelding themſelues vnto the ſenſible obiects, which offer themſelues vnto them. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe ſo to yeeld vnto them, as that they cauſe thoſe obiects to ſerue them and reaſon, whereof, they ſhould be altogether in very deed made. Now, of all the paſſions ouer which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26781:33"/> temperance muſt haue an eſpeciall eye, to arrange theſe vnto reaſon, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie concupiſcence, is the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, which tieth vs vnto the luſt of the fleſh, making vs to ſeeke out, in the coniunction ordeined by God, not the bleſſing of a long and happie poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſubſtitute in our ſteads, ſeruants vnto our creator, but a beaſtly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and infamous delight, which blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our ſoules, and maketh our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites drunke. God hauing heaped in man ſo many ſundrie perfections, meant yet notwithſtanding as it were to finiſh the ſame, and did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him that, which is the moſt wonderfull in all the deitie, which was, the making him a creator like vnto himſelfe. For as he created the world that his power might be ſeene &amp; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before him, his wiſedom in his works, ſo alſo would he, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould beget another, one like vnto himſelfe, that he might ſee alſo himſelfe in his owne worke, and loue and cheriſh that which came of himſelfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gaue him a wife, to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with him in this workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Nay, he did more then this,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26781:34"/> for his meaning was, that man, who was bond and thrall vnto death, looked that there ſhould one day, one of his poſteritie, be borne of a Virgine, who ſhould be the Sauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the world, ſtirring him vp as it were religiouſlie to vſe an holy vnion, which ſhould ſerue to the miniſterie of his redemption. Wherefore, as the vſe of this coniunction at this day, is no more neceſſarie for our ſaluation, which for vs is fully purchaſed, neither left vnto vs, but as a lawfull intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, if ſo be we are not able to paſſe it, yet let vs vſe it at the leaſt as a remedy of infirmity vnder the authority of the law of God, for the cooling and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the luſts of the fleſh, which bud &amp; ſpring out in vs. And ſeeing that the deſire which caſteth vs out of our ſelues cannot driue vs to loue God as we ſhould, let vs yet, at the leaſt, keep it within the chaſte boſom of her, whom God hath deſtined for our wife &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.

For, firſt they breake the law of God, who commaundeth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie: the law of nature, which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to make that common, which is borne for one alone: the law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hath brought in marriages: and the law of families, vniuſtly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the labour and trauell of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other vnto a ſtrange heire.

                  </gap> from a liuely and pleaſant Fountaine, all publike and particular calamities as it were. For when this fooliſh loue is once formed in our ſoules, which being nouriſhed with belly-cheere and idleneſſe, beginneth there to grow and encreaſe, and hath as heady wine run through our vaines, it by and by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our ſences a ſleepe, and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth our members, bereaueth our reaſon, and ſo furiouſly reigning ouer vs, carrieth vs away violently into moſt furious purpoſes and practiſes. Do we not ſee at this day the mightieſt king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to be by it digged downe as it were with Pickaxes, and Empires to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26781:35"/> ſtumble and fall downe to ruine. And do we not ſee that it deuoureth in one day the ritches and conqueſts of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worlds? That it openeth the gate to all iniuſtice? Hath it not brought ielowſie betweene brethren, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels betweene Fathers and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? But the worſt and fouleſt of all the effects that it hath wrought, is, the vncertaintie that it bringeth into the minds of kinſmen and families. For, in defiling the mariage bed, it taketh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the children the loue of their father, which cannot be conſerued but by the good opinion that the husband hath of the chaſtitie of his wife, &amp; it breaketh alſo the pietie of the children towards their fathers, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be founded but vpon the ſelf &amp; ſame conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now, when theſe bonds of affection &amp; good will are loſt amongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how can they conteine themſelues within any ciuill amity and ſociety? how can they ioyne &amp; vnite themſelues together, to ſerue God &amp; obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements? This ſinne, as an ancient father ſaith, is the deuils hauen, which floting &amp; flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vs through voluptuouſnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually rebloweth the bellowes of our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:26781:35"/> ſences with new hoat deſires, which ſet our ſoules on fire, &amp; there nouriſheth them with ſmoake, taking from them both ſight &amp; iudgement, which ſhould guide them to euery good thing. And therfore how far ſoeuer we can ſee this fooliſh loue, we muſt hunt it away, and deteſt it, as the very poiſon of our ſouls. Howbeit we, contrariwiſe, call it vnto vs, and make much of it, how farre ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be from vs. For we inuite it to giue it reward, and the rewards of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor are for none but for his officers, &amp; all the moſt fine and rare wits take the greateſt delight to impe his feathers, that he might the ſpeedelier and more contentedly come flying into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Princes. Now, a Chriſtian man eſpecially ſuch a one as would attaine vnto this bleſſed conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whervnto we prepare him, will bereaue his ſoule of all theſe filthy luſts, &amp; vſing himſelfe vnto this continuall contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor himſelf, if he poſſibly can, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this treaſure of virginity, wherin lieth a great purity of the mind &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of vnderſtanding: &amp; they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſerue the ſame, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelues with the ſpirit of God.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26781:36"/> which gaue S. <hi>Ierome</hi> occaſion to ſay according to <hi>Varro;</hi> That the reward of virginity was diuination: becauſe that diuination is nothing els but the knowledge of the truth to come, which we attaine vnto by communicating with God, that, which we neuer can obtaine, except we keepe our ſelues pure from all earthly and beaſtly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. So as (as we haue before ſaid) if that our infirmitie ſurmounteth our diſcourſe, we may make our intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance lawfull &amp; excuſable, in rightly vſing the remedie which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto our infirmitie, and ſo be like vnto thoſe firſt Chriſtians of whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid; That they were not borne men, but for ther wiues. Let vs therefore with reuerence enter into this ſocietie of marriage, and let it be a coniunction both of the ſpirit and will, a communion both of faith and religion, wherein nothing is proper ne yer particular, no not ſo much as the very ſecret thoughts themſelues. This is, as <hi>Themiſtius</hi> the Platoniſt ſaid, a full mixture of all together, as wine and water, which being once mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, can neuer be ſeperated againe.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:26781:36"/> Heereby we ſee wherein the principall effect of this Temperance ſhould reſt. To ſtirre vp men vnto ſobrietie, and deteſt infamous foule gluttonie, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy delicacie of meates and drinkes, neither is vertue thereby any whit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, but through bond ſlaues and tranſgreſſours; for ſuch luſts very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome grow in an honeſt mind. Such luſts are very ſeldome found in the minds of wiſemen. Although the ages heeretofore haue borne and brought foorth monſtrous <hi>Sardanapales,</hi> who made their bellies their God. The common cry of the people themſelues deteſt them, and are ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the voice of the multitude, although wiſdom ſhould no way deale with them about the matter. It is very true, that when ſuch ſpirits are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with great cheere, they can neuer talke of any thing that is either honeſt or yet godly, which ſhould make them capable of that contemplation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we call them. Now, when as <hi>Philo</hi> deſcribeth out vnto vs the liues of theſe good religious Egyptians, he therein noteth out vnto vs ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſobriety, as that it is impoſſible
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:26781:37"/> for bodies which kept ſuch a diet could any way hinder the beautifull actions of their ſoule. And therefore let vs vſe meates, and ſuch other like tranſitorie good things, for the ſtrengthening and vpholding of the infirmitie of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the neceſſary inſtrument of the ſpirit. But we muſt not ſo deale with our bodies as men deale with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the magnificence of Princes, which are ſo ſtiffened with embrodery and Goldſmithes worke, and ſo beſet with Pearles &amp; precious ſtones, as that a man can ſcarſly ſtir himſelfe when they are on his back but we muſt make vs ſuch a garment as muſt ſerue for euery day, and take ſuch a fold as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to giue it. There is alſo another thing which hindreth our ſoules no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe paſſions wherof we haue already ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that is choler, which to ſpeake truly, is the faireſt flower of follie: and that is that paſſion which blindeth vs all at once, when as it hath once taken hold of vs, &amp; maketh things appeare vnto vs, as it were through a clowd, cleane otherwiſe then in deed they are, &amp; is ſo much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a gueſt, by how much the more
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26781:37"/> that they that are poſſeſſed therewith, are mighty, &amp; of great power &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for the choller of princes which is aided by reaſon of their power, flyeth out like lightning, &amp; breaketh out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch time as a man can ſee the flaſh, or heare the crack thereof: &amp; as the thunder and lightning breaketh a ſword in the ſcabard, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo doth chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler puniſh, without knowing any cauſe, inſomuch that they purſue their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the moſt part with moſt tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnprofitable repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to do no more as great as they are, but to wiſh that that which is ill done, were vndone. For as <hi>Pyndare</hi> ſaith, God himſelf hath no other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer that that is paſt, but to forget, and ſo they are for the moſt part, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to repent them of that at leiſure, which in their haſt they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Howbeit, for the repreſſing of this furious haſt, we muſt frame a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirit, which we call <hi>Clemency,</hi> by which, our wils being vnaduiſedly prickt forward to wiſh euill to another, and the deſire of reuenge are reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; repreſſed, when as we ſhall haue this <hi>clemency</hi> rightly framed in vs by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26781:38"/> perfect obſeruation of our maners, ſhe will temper vs with ſuch a milde and gratious behauiour, as ſhall defend our reaſon from ſuch a tedious and ſtrong impreſſion as choller is. She will make vs take leiſure to iudge of things by weight and meaſure, to counſell our friends therunto, and diſſwade vs from beleeuing and truſting too much to our owne ſelues. Wherefore ſhe will infinitely ſerue vs to perſwade our ſelues, that we cannot be offended but with our ſelues, neither yet once keepe in our breſts thoſe iniuries which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done vnto vs. For, if our actions be pure and ſound, and our life holy and innocent, can our venimous and hatefull tongue change it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our neighbour? And if we at any time propound vnto our ſelues to liue to the good liking of any one man, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall we be able to find the meanes to pleaſe all the world, and content both good and bad together? if we iuſtifie vs before God and our ſelues, &amp; haue cleane and vndefiled conſciences, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall then do vs hurt. Thou wouldeſt hurt me in my good name, and thinkeſt by falſly accuſing me of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:26781:38"/> my life, greatly to wrong me: and I haue God, men, and mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to teſtifie againſt thee, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and iuſtifie me. Thou maieſt haue a will to hurt me, howbeit I need not feele it without I will. Thou takeſt and carrieſt away my goods from me, all this mooueth me not: or the time was that I had none, or I had them when I was ſo yong, as that I knew not what to do with them: and laſtly, although thou haddeſt left them vnto me, yet carried I not them with me when I dyed: and I muſt either leaue them, or elſe they muſt leaue me. And why ſhould I be more ſorie for the one then for the other? Well thou greeueſt me in my body, thou beateſt and hurteſt me, and behold the Souldier which returneth very ioyfully from the skirmiſh, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his arme in a ſcarfe, maketh more account of his wound, then he doth of his life, if ſo be he bring from thence a great gaſh, either in his head or in his face, the more he beholdeth himſelfe, the more he wondereth at himſelfe: If he come home with the ſtring halt of one of his legges, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a ſtep, but he reioyceth that he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:26781:39"/> was ſo gloriouſly marked. Wherefore they are not our wounds that do ſo greeue and trouble vs, but the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the which we receiue them, &amp; they bring vs either honor or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, neither is any thing eſteemed for the thing it ſelfe, but for the end why we do it. If we endure all things for the honor of God, and for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we ſhall obtaine through our patience, then that which we call euill ſhall turne to our good, and that which once ſeemed to vs to be bitter, ſhall in the end be found very ſweet. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which this moderation of ſpirit ſhall bring vs, will be a ſecret teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnto vs, that we are the faithfull ſeruants of our maiſter, that we ſpare our ſelues no whit at all to obey him, nor yet refuſe any trauell or paine, to put his commandements in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is nothing, ſurely, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in this world, euen in the iudgement of the very heathen, as to vnderſtand how to forgiue and pardon. The lawes permit euery man to purſue the wrong done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: but to pardon and forgiue, belongeth vnto a Prince alone. And
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26781:39"/> therefore if thou wilt be a king ouer thy ſelfe, forgiue thy ſelfe freely: for the glory of a Chriſtian conſiſteth chiefly in this loue, by which he bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his neighbour to loue him, and to be voide of this worldly deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, which as a worme gnaweth the hart of thoſe which are infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, toſſeth &amp; turmoileth them all the day, and keepeth them waking all the night. And therefore the ſpirit will compoſe it ſelfe with this equalitie, as that it will not ſuffer it ſelfe to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with hatred and euill will. And from thence will enſue another excellent diſpoſition of the ſoule, which is modeſty &amp; moderation, which bringeth with it a certaine comlineſſe vnto all the actions of the body, and is a teſtimonie by them of gentleneſſe &amp; goodwill, &amp; vertue, which can do more then all the reſt, to make vs ſociable, &amp; to get vs the friendſhip of thoſe with whom either our nature, good hap, or choiſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioineth vs. This gratious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſo agreeable vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as nothing more, for ſhe wringeth out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which force is no way able to do: for ſhe deſireth no ſuperiority ouer the reſt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:26781:40"/> but according to reaſon, which is a kind of weapon that will cut deeper then either yron or ſteele. But theſe proud, frowning and ſcornefull people, which looke at all the world ouer their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are therwith ſwolne ſo full as their skinnes can hold, and looke at their tailes like vnto proud Peacocks, do reaſon great wrong, when as they ſo do, clothing him with ſuch talke as vtterly diſgraceth him, and maketh him odious. And beleeue me, it is a very hard thing for theſe men to come any thing neere this holy Philoſophie or wiſedome, which dwelleth amongſt the graces that garde and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

Now, becauſe that for the moſt part it commeth by reaſon of our infirmitie, as thinking to fly one ſinne, we fall into another, we

For, firſt we ſhall on the one ſide haue raſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to egge vs forward to deſire more, then that wherevnto God hath called vs, and oppoſe our ſelues vnto his conſtant and firme purpoſe. Our happie ſucceſſes, and proſperous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters or accidents, will ſo tickle vs, as that they will make vs laugh, our good hap will promiſe vs high and great things, and yet for all this, we will not once change our viſage nor countenance. We will ſcornefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and looke vpon, and that with a

But if reaſon telleth vs that we muſt take them, we will then vſe them with great equalitie of minde, and facilitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and make none other eſtimation of them. On the other ſide, we ſhall haue afflictions, dangers, griefes, and pouertie, which in the iudgement of the common people, wrappeth vp all manner of miſeries. And it is againſt theſe enemies chieflie that this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue muſt boiſterouſlie ſtretch forth her armes: It is through them that ſhe muſt make way, if ſhe meane to come to the end of her purpoſe. Howbeit if we our ſelues ſtand in no feare, and flie not before ſuch time as we ſee the enemie, what miſchiefe may they do vs? Forſooth, they will ſpoile vs of all our goods, and ſo we ſhall go the lighter: ſeeing then that the reward is reſerued for him that commeth firſt, and ſhall the longer while enioy the immortall goddes which ſooneſt

And now behold the breach is made, and our Captaine within that calleth vs, and we our ſelues buſie our ſelues to ſhoote at him that arreſteth vs by the cloake, and put our ſelues in hazard to remaine priſoners in the hands of the enemie, that will cauſe vs loſo both cloake and honour, and the fruite alſo of all our trauell. We are threatned with death, and what other thing elſe is it that we ſeeke after? We haue not clothed our ſelues with this tranſitorie and mortall life, but onely to pay the tribute, and diſcharge the tolle at the comming in of euerlaſting life. Theſe are good newes, ſeeing we are called vpon to pay, for it is a token that we are come on ſhore. But what is this death that thus terrifieth vs?

Hath not the memorie of poſteritie, taken them out of their graues, to make them aliue againe in the remembrance of men?

And therefore that which we call life, is but a death, becauſe it dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without leauing any memory ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for, that which we call death, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in very deed life, becauſe it is that which maketh vs to be &amp; continue for euer. Neither are we to regard how long we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26781:42"/> liue, but how wel we liue: neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth death too ſoone if he bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with him, neither is it for the only opinion of another, and for the honor which we ſhall get by well dying, that ought to make vs contemne death, but for the loue of that ſecond life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into we muſt enter. The <hi>Druydes,</hi> had ſome forefeeling of the immortalitie of our ſoules, which cauſed them to be more valiant then all the people of tho world: for, they made a skorne to ſaue their liues, ſaying, that they made no more accoumpt of them, then of the head of a willow tree. And the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who made a ieſt at them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed yet, that they held a bleſſed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Howbeit, we ſay, that their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was bleſſed, by taſting of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, whereby they found groping in the darke, the very reſting place of felicitie, and had found out the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſon, which driueth away and ſlayeth feare, the very poyſon of our ſoules, which drieth vp, and feebliſheth our hearts and minds. But we, being brought vp and taught in a better Schoole then they were, do not only know, but conſtantly beleeue, and not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:26781:43"/> only beleeue, but are glad alſo as a man would ſay, of this ſecond immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life. For, we haue a ſpirit lodging in the inward part of our ſoule, which ſayeth and ſoundeth continually, if ſo be we will heare it, nothing elſe but this life to come. And vnto this voyce it is, that ſo many millions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue in the middeſt of their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and torments followed the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard or enſigne of their Captaine, ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſheading their bloud in all the corners of the earth, as the true and pure ſeed oſ faith. This is that Trompet which hath encouraged them to fight this combat, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they haue returned very bloudy, but yet haue bene triumphant, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victorers. If ambitious honor dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs vnto moſt ſtrange hazards of warre, if this affection, to be eſteemed and honored of thoſe before whome wee liue, haſtneth and kindleth the courſe of our actions, what greater hope is there of theſe which haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned this? for they haue not onely bene honored whilſt they liued, but wee alſo reuerence theyr aſhes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are dead, theyr bones are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:26781:43"/> holie vnto vs: the memorie of their liues is yeerely renued with deuout commemorations and prayers: wee honor them in our verie thoughtes, wee humble our cogitations before them, as placed in a great degree of honor in the Church of God, and as hauing found grace before the face of our Lorde and God. And therefore wee muſt not bee voyde of courage for the effectuall brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to paſſe of good and holie things, ſeeing that the verie wicked them ſelues, are the better part of theyr dayes ſo valiant in executing theſe wicked and moſt deteſtable things. For with this patience and ſtrength of courage, muſt wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter triumphing into the kingdome of glorie, wee hauing bene told by <hi>Toby</hi> this goodly and holy Oracle, <hi>That hee O Lord which ſerueth thee with all his heart, if his life be put in hazard, ſhall bee without doubt crowned.</hi> And for this cauſe it is why the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture telleth vs, that this good. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beeing brought into miſerable captiuitie &amp; thraldome, did neuer for all that forſake the voyce of the truth.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:26781:44"/> And to ſay truly, we can no way iuſtly attribute vnto our ſelues the name of Chriſtians, if we reiect and forſake the Croſſe which is left vnto vs in ſtead of all other maner of weapons, and is the very ſample &amp; paterne that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath geuen vs, to make vs vnderſtand when we ſhall come vnto him, and the watchword that witneſſeth vnto vs that we are his. For, we haue no means that can make vs perceiue that we are inſtructed in his diſcipline, but by this patience, the very mother of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> alſo ſayth, That the Martyres run vnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orments as vnto the ſchoole &amp; exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. It now followeth that we ſee how we ſhould behaue and carry our ſelues in the diſpoſing of the benefits which it pleaſeth God to beſtow vpon vs. In very deede, the rule which hereof is ſet before vs, and the habit which we take vpon vs to vſe them well, is called <hi>Liberalitie.</hi> Now, the firſt precept which we are to learne, is to acknowledge, that all the benefits which we haue, we hold of the goodnes &amp; grace of God: the ordinary exerciſe whereof, is to do good vnto all the world, and to ſpread
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26781:44"/> vpon vs his bleſſings, albeit we no whit deſerue them. And the reaſon why he ſo bountifully deſtributeth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, is not to the end we ſhould locke them vp, and let the gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mould, which are no way good nor profitable but when they are well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but to the end that as he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated vs vnto his owne image, ſo alſo we ſhould imitate him, in well doing vnto our neighbour, according to our abilities. And truly we haue farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion to do it then he. For, that which he geueth is his owne, and he geueth it to ſuch alſo, as be no way able to do him good. But we, are another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s purſe-bearers, we geue the goods of our God, &amp; we geue them to ſuch as are not onely able to pay vs againe, but alſo to lend vs as much when we ſtand in need. And although they ſhould be vnable to pay, yet God, by whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement we geue them, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs the ſame for them, and maketh it his owne debt, and chargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo not only to pay the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, but to geue vſury for it, yea double, treble, and an hundreth fold. And we are beſides to conſider, that all theſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26781:45"/> benefits ſhould be dealt proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, for our neceſſties, and that by the lawe of nature, they belong not vnto vs, no further then wee haue neede of them for the maintenance of our life. The meaſure of our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are heate, cold, hunger, and thirſt: and if the cuſtome of the countrey wherein we liue, and faſhions of our countreymen, induce vs to any neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fineneſſe, we muſt not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too too auſterely refuſe it, neyther yet ouercuriouſly affect the ſame. Wherein, wee are firſt to regard in what ſtate and degree of honor God hath placed vs amongſt our brethren, and which is ſortable vnto the eſtate whereunto we are borne or called, to the end wee might appropriat our goods vnto our ſelues, and not our ſelues vnto our goods. Now, when we haue furniſhed our ſelues with aſmuch as is needfull for our eſtate, we muſt lay the reſt by, and be very watchfull in the well beſtowing therof. And that which may ſerue to direct vs thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is to take away the merite and the neceſſitie of ſuch as we would beſtow the ſame on: for, it is the equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26781:45"/> &amp; meaſure, which chiefly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the deede holy and pleaſing vnto God, who hath diſpoſed all things by meaſure, &amp; hath geuen vnto vs reaſon as a compaſſe, to make all our actions iuſt &amp; euen like vnto his. For if I geue my goods vnto him that hath no need, and ſee a poore man dye at my feet for want of food, this is an indiſcreet libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie in the rich, &amp; manſlaughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poore man. If I for the helping of a ſtranger, let my father and mother want, the order of true &amp; naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is peruerted, and mine action is diſgraced. We are alſo to obſerue the things by which we mean to place our good deeds, and ſome be more vrgent then otherſome: for, we may doubt of ſome of them, in our geuing, &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may pluck the good deed into our own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: howbeit we are prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipally to take heed, that we geue not away that which is another mans: for, they that take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one man to geue to another, are abhominable before God, and their almes &amp; offrings ſtinke in his noſtrels, &amp; he turneth his face cleane fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: and according to the ſaying of the Wiſema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who ſaith, <hi>That he which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26781:46"/> offereth vnto God the fruite of his iniquitie, that offering is moſt foule and filthie.</hi> We ſhould make a great accoumpt of this vertue, to frame and faſhion it very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſound in our minds, as being full of all ſpirituall grace, that might greatly further vs vnto our ſaluation, when as it ſhall accuſtome vs, liberally to diſtribute our goods to thoſe that haue need of them, and our almes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his honor which hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs them. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was not afeard to ſay, that almes is another Baptiſme: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that as water putteth out the fier, euen ſo doth almes kill ſinne. This almes (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayth) is Gods friend, which obtayneth at his hands whatſoeuer ſhe craueth: ſhe ſetteth priſoners at libertie, calleth home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thoſe that are baniſhed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth pardon for the condemned. For, the hand of the poore, is Gods purſe. Haue wee any thing to buy of him? let vs then geue him our money. And the beſt way for vs to beſtow our goods, is to put them into Gods banke, for he will aſſure it vs not only on the land and the whole continent thereof, which is his, but alſo in heauen, and in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26781:46"/> eternall bliſſe, wherewith he will ſeaſe, and inueſt vs. Why ſhould we then be ſo fooliſh as to ſuffer our gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to ruſt in our cheſts, and ſo, alwaies blindfold our minds, with laying vp crowne by crowne, ſeeing we ſuffer the time to paſſe for the doing of our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and that all which we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſcrape together, is nothing but toyle vpon toyle heaped vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Surely, all theſe goods which bring with them nothing elſe but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe with their only aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in which are neuer fulneſſe nor yet meaſure, are nothing elſe but a cage of gold, and a priſon of ſiluer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their maiſters, to hold them faſt bound to the vpper part of the earth, &amp; thereby bereaue them of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for going vnto heauen. This is the water that is powred vpon the Egles wings, becauſe he ſhould not flye vp vnto the Sunne. Euen ſo muſt they that will taſte of the fruite of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and attaine vnto perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, where the courſe of our ſoule muſt reſt, take heed that they hinder not them ſelues, but as little as they can in the dirty dunghill of riches,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:26781:47"/> which are no better then very clay and earth, what great accompt ſoeuer they make of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet notwithſtanding it is for this duſt that we kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is it which we ſet both our ſouls &amp; bodies on the teinters for. For this, great and mightie cities band the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues one againſt another in arms &amp; battel: this, is the very plague of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſocietie: this, is the water of ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which parteth brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſunder, yea which ſeperateth the father from the child. And therefore we had need ſet a fourth &amp; the loſt bar betwixt vs &amp; our affections, to keepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſiring that which is another mans, &amp; to teach vs to geue to euery one that which is his owne. And this vertue, we call <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> wherof if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider in generall, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth within her ſelf al ſorts of vertues: and her office, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> teacheth vs, is firſt to ioyne men together with God, ſecondly, to reconcile one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another, which are two things verie neerely knit together. For, if the firſt keepe vs within that duty wherin God hath created vs, which is, to feare, loue, and ſerue him, and do good vnto our neighbour, it cannot be but that we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26781:47"/> muſt ſtand in the grace and fauour both of God and men. Or if we will more particularly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and wherein ſhe diſpoſeth vs to liue iuſtly and lawfully with men, her action may very fitly be deuided into three parts or heads. The firſt is, to liue honeſtly, without breaking the lawes either of God, or of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The other is, not to offend any man, either in word or deed. The third is, to geue vnto euery man that which is his owne. Now, if as much ſhould be ſpoken of this argument as might be, we ſhould exceed that meaſue that I haue preſcribed and ſet downe for this ſmall treatiſe. And therefore it ſhall ſuffice that we ſpeake of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing which is recommended vnto vs by <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which is, to keepe our faith in all our doings, to take in hand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing craftily &amp; cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly, but to deale plainly &amp; openly in all our affaires. For ouer &amp; beſides, that faith is the knot &amp; common band of the amitie &amp; ſocietie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo alſo is it vnto vs as gage, of the grace of God which he hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vs, to communicate himſelf with vs. And ſeeing that by this &amp; the ſelf ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:26781:48"/> word, is ſignified vnto vs the aſſurance which we haue of our ſaluation, and conſtancy of our promiſe, we are veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeue, that whoſoeuer ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this pawne amongſt men, will lightly abuſe that gage which God hath geuen him. And in very deede, whoſoeuer he is that ſhall ſet before his eyes the lawe of God, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which therein is denounced, and the paines that are prepared for the wicked, is it poſſible that that man will euer haue the heart to deceiue him, whome the lawe hath commaunded to loue as him ſelfe? will he, by defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his neighbour, deceiue his owne ſoule of that euerlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereof thoſe men can neuer be partakers, who communicate with the father of lying, and of lyes? For, truth commeth from heauen, &amp; falſhood, in the daughter of darkeneſſe. All kinds of fiction, coulored and counterfeit ſhewes and all leaſings, are the craftie deuiſes of the deuill: and he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth them, and vſeth them, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanteth with the wicked ſpirits, and maketh himſelfe the bondſlaue of ſin. And therefore all our actions ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:26781:48"/> be ſincere and faithfull, but eſpecially their actions who are in authoritie to gouerne the people, and are put in truſt to render iuſtice vnto euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man. They muſt not do as the Egiptian Iudges did, that ware the image of Iuſtice about their necks, but they muſt haue it imprinted in the bottome of their hearts, and betweene their lips, for ſhe alone it is that muſt direct their iudgements, ſo as neither loue nor hatred, muſt at any hand make the ballance or ſcales which they hold in their hands, leane either one way or other, but reaſon alone muſt cauſe the lawe ſpurne and kick againſt iniquitie. Surely, no man can haue a better teſtimonie vnto his conſcience of his election, then when as he feeleth himſelf to take pleaſure in dealing iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightuouſly: for whoſoeuer he is that loueth iuſtice, is a man of God: for, the light ſhineth on the righteous man, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that is of an vpright hart. The way and path of the iuſt, is like vnto the dawning of the day, her light encreaſeth by little and little, and becommeth like vnto the noonetide. The wiſe man could not more properly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26781:49"/> compare iuſtice vnto any thing, then vnto the light: for, as the light ſhineth not for it ſelfe, but cauſeth others to ſee: euen ſo this moſt excellent ſound vertue of it ſelfe, looketh not but vnto the benefit &amp; profit of another, hauing none other end but by a well willing &amp; righteous affection, to conioyne &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine one another of vs. When this vertue is growne vnto a full perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe ſtraightwayes beginneth to loue, &amp; may very wel take vnto her that name, becauſe that ſhe, hauing vnited &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined vs together, teacheth vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt our ſelues to be one anothers fleſh, as being the members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or rather, the body of one head, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in vs a charitable affection, which is the ſouldering &amp; ſinowing of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies together. For, as we ſee in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our perſons, euery member to be ſo framed therein, as that, that which is fardeſt off, moueth it ſelfe forthwith in affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; good liking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſt: ſo as if we haue any paine in our foot, by &amp; by the eye looketh vnto it, &amp; ſtraightways we put to the hand, &amp; in the end bend the whole force of our body to help to do it good. Euen ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:26781:49"/> it with the miſtical coniunction of the body, &amp; in the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation of the faithfull, whereof we are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the ſpirit of God which doth rule and gouerne vs, teacheth vs, that for our owne conſeruation, we muſt needs make one of another, and make both our aduerſitie and proſperitie common, that we might contribute vnto the neceſſities of one another. For, our chriſtian righteouſnes, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not vs only, to diſcharge the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile and politick bands which may be amongſt vs, but alſo acquiteth this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall obligation, which bindeth one man to another by mutuall good will and loue. It remayneth now, that this righteouſneſſe muſt conioyne vs vnto God, and bring forth her moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t effects, which kepeth our ſoule vpright quiet, &amp; capable of the wil of God, and as it were faſt tied vnto the loue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting bliſſe, which is done by the gifts of faith &amp; hope. For, after we haue purged our ſelues of the peruerſe &amp; fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which our ſoul hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into her by liuing on erth, &amp; ſo blinded our wil, as that ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not returne to ill, yet muſt ſhe go on to her mark, &amp; guide
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26781:50"/> her ſelf vnto her reſting place. Now, as we are caſt downe into the darkeneſſe of this world, into the deſerts of ſin, &amp; bottomleſſe deapths of perdition, we cannot ſee our end without light, nor find our way without a guide, ne yet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine our ſelues &amp; go forward without ſtay: and our light, guide, and ſtay is, the reuelation which God hath ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs out of his will, the knowledge which he hath geuen vnto vs by his grace, the ſpirit, by which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth himſelf with vs, and in the end commeth himſelfe vnto vs, becauſe we are ſo feeble, as that we cannot go vnto him. We call faith the ſound and right affection, whereby wee receiue that, which he declareth vnto vs, and which we conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly beleeue, and by which, we iudge of him in the goodnes &amp; ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of our harts. This is it with which we humble our ſenſes, and with which we deny our ſelues to geue credit vnto his truth, in acknowledging our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, &amp; by which we allow his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; admire the effects ſo often reiterated, for the reconquering of our ſaluation, &amp; deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death. Now, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as our ſoule hath
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:26781:50"/> once found her ſelf diſpoſed to belieue this, and receiued this impreſſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God, ſhe then cleerly ſeeth the marke whereat ſhe aimeth, &amp; kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing thereby the benefit which is ſet before her, ſhe is touched with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain effectual feeling of pleaſure, which eggeth her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually forward to wiſh &amp; looke for the ſaluation which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her. This is that hope by the which ſhe foreſeeth the happy hour of her felicitie, by which ſhe is kept for the loking for her bleſſednes, &amp; vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den &amp; double ſtrengthened againſt all the griefes and miſeries which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght ſhake the ſame, and croſſe her in the way. Here then wee ſee how we muſt prepare our ſoule to make it capable of this felicitie. We muſt now then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſee &amp; behold by her dealing, how ſhe delighteth her ſelf in this moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pleaſure. And it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two maner of wayes, the one is, that whilſt ſhe is clad about with this fleſh, and detained here in this vile world, yet ſhe ſtill ioyneth and vniteth her ſelfe vnto God her creator, by meanes of her pure &amp; holy diſpoſition, and of her good and charitable works.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:26781:51"/> The other is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is deliuered &amp; deſpoiled of the earth, &amp; the world, ſhe wholy vniteth her ſelf vnto her firſt &amp; originall being. In this firſt eſtate we ſhal ſee her reioice in ſuch happineſſe, pleaſure, &amp; contentment, as infinitely ſurpaſſeth all the other delights which we poſſibly are able to wiſh or deſire here below. And ſuch in very deed, as are no way comparable vnto thoſe pleaſures which we know to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs in the life to come, and ſuch in truth, as our thoughts cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. For it is very true (which <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſayth) That man, that liueth here in this world, can comprehend nothing but earthly things. And it is ſayd in <hi>Eccleſiaſt. That wee muſt not ſearch into things aboue our reach, but thinke vpon that which God hath commaunded vs: for it is not fit for vs to looke vnto that which God keepeth ſecret vnto himſelfe from vs.</hi> Now, the bleſſeddeſt and chiefeſt pleaſure of our ſoule, conſiſteth in conforming &amp; addreſſing all her doings to that end wherunto ſhe is created, which is done by action, prayer, and meditation.

And this meditation conſiſteth only of the knowledge of the truth, and glory of God, which we muſt ſeeke after as wel by the contemplation, and exact conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his works, out of which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth forth euerywhere his power &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable goodnes, as by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reading of his word, by which he openeth vnto vs the treaſure of his wiſedome, and draweth the curtaines

And the works of God vndoubtedly, are as ſcaling ladders ſet vp for vs euery where to climb vp vnto him. For, let vs turne our ſelues which way ſoeuer we will, and we ſhall finde here in the world wonderfull things: for if we looke downe into the depth of the bowels of the earth, we ſhall ſee there ſuch a number of veines of gold and ſiluer, ſuch a ſort of pretious mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and ſuch ſpring heads of liuely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as is wonderfull. Again, if we looke vpon the face of the earth, we ſhal find ſuch varietie of hearbs, floures, fruits, trees, beaſts of the fields, and in them ſuch vertues, and ſecret properties, as that it would make vs altogether aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And are the ſeas leſſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by reaſon of their ebbing &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing? the multitude of fiſhes, and the diuerſitie of monſters, which they feed &amp; bring ſorth?

And when as we lift vp our eyes far higher, and behold the curtaines of heauen ſpread vpon the

Let man but looke into himſelf, &amp; conſider with himſelfe what maner a thing he is, and how ſo litle a moyſt humor could make him grow vnto ſuch a faſhion, to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a body of ſo many ſundry parts, with ſuch proportion. And let him not content himſelfe to ſee himſelfe ſtand vpright vppon his feete, with his face vpward, his eyes open, and remouing all his members, but let him a litle vncouer his skin, and gheſſe how the fleſh and the bones are ſo

Let him alſo ſee what a number of arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are guided from the heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to accompanie all the ſinewes and veynes, to hold in the vitall ſpirits in euery part, as the meſſengers of his will, to the end, to commaund the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes to moue, or not to moue. Let him then if he will, lay open his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and ſee how his life is maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how the meates ſent downe into the ſtomacke, are transformed by a ſecret and incomprehenſible power, how, by laboring and ſtirring in the ſtomack, they runne into the paunch, how the good iuice floweth through the ſmall vaines into the liuer, which is the ſhop of the bloud: how the liuer diſchargeth her ſuperfluities into the gall, ſplene, and kidneys, how it diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26781:54"/> the bloud into the veynes, and how it is ſent into the heart to be there made thin and ſubtilized, euen vnto the confection of the vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. If he behold the moouing and breathing of the lights, which refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and moderateth the heat of the heart, if he ſee the artificiall turnings and wreathings of the guts, let him not thinke the ſame, to be fallen out of the clouds, neither yet that he ſeeth any other thing within, then he ſeeth without. Howbeit, when as he ſhall come to conſider of the head, which is the treaſure of the ſences, and ſeat of reaſon, let him dreame amongſt other things, what an eſpeciall worke the eye is, and with how many filmes and thin skinnes, this lightſome ſpirit is garniſhed and defended, which in very truth is the pleaſure of the life, he ſhall remaine as it were aſtoniſhed and amazed, but yet not ſo much, as when he commeth to pierce the braine, where he ſhall perceiue the manner whereon the portracture and images of things are borne by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as faithfull meſſengers and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, to be receiued and exerciſed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26781:55"/> therein by the common ſence: and afterward to be ordered and placed within the cuſtodie of the celles of the memorie. But the thing that moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſheth vs, is this, when as we deſire to vnderſtand what our ſoule is, which manageth &amp; gouerneth all this whole workemanſhip, what a power it is of, that thus ſtrangely moueth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, which awaketh when we ſleepe, comprehendeth ſo eaſily and things, reacheth into the deepeſt matters, and by diſcourſe, findeth out the cauſe and reaſon of the moſt ſecret things. And we ſee and feele theſe effects in our ſelues, and yet we can neither ſee nor yet conceiue them. Certainly, when we, in the contemplation of theſe things, are lifted vp by faith, we feele our ſelues forthwith led vnto the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe workes. And to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as we ſee ſo many maruelous things diſperſed throughout the whole face of the earth, for what other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſerue they, but to be as a booke left wide open, for vs to read out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the greatneſſe and almightie power of God, who is heereby ſo gloriouſly expreſſed? The onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

This is it, whereon we ſhould ſtudie day and night, and not content our ſelues with the bare looking of the couer onely, but diligently to way the periodes, yea, euen to pluck out the ſillabes and meaneſt points, which containe excellent and holy ſecrets. And this was a very good anſwer in my opinion, which the good Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite S. <hi>Anthonie</hi> (as <hi>Socrates</hi> writeth) made vnto a Philoſopher, who asked him how he could poſſiblie dwell in a ſolitarie place, without hauing of bookes about him? Surely (quoth he) I lacke no bookes, for the world is my booke, and my ſtudie, is the contemplation of nature, wherein I reade day and night, of the glory of my God: howbeit, I can neuer attaine to the end thereof. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie life voide of ſuch a number of boiling ſorrowes and greefes, which vndermine and conſume our yeares, gladding and reioycing in this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reſt, and hauing good leaue

This is that voice, which is called the burning worde; this is that word which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the light, which, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, is like vnto fier, becauſe it doth not only heate, lighten, and make ripe, but alſo melteth, ſofteneth, and hardeneth.

And theſe are they that haue moſt profoundly entred into the diuine wiſedome, and who for that occaſion, are in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures called <hi>Seers:</hi> for they are they, by

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, whoſoeuer he be that would do that that ſhould further his ſaluation, and follow the way of him which ſaith; <hi>If any man will follow me, let him forſake
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:26781:61"/> himſelf, and take vp his croſſe and follow me, the ſame man without doubt ſhall finde rest vnto his ſoule.</hi> For as the eye which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually mooueth, and rolleth it ſelfe hither and thither, ſometime high and ſometime lowe, can neuer looke ſtraite vpon any thing, and therefore if he will looke well, he muſt ſtedfaſtly caſt and fixe his eye altogether vpon one point: euen ſo, mans vnderſtanding being drawne away with a thouſand ſundrie cares, cannot well bend it ſelfe aright vnto the knowledge of the truth: for the vnmaried man ſhall be carried away with foule and beaſtly deſires and luſts, troubled with fooliſh and furious loue toyes, &amp; other vnbrideled deſires. And on the otherſide, with how many cares ſhal the maried ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be thwarted, for if he hath no children, that will be a great corſiue to him: he muſt alſo haue an eye vnto his wife, he muſt prouide for the neceſſaries of his houſe, he muſt be at charges with his ſeruants, he ſhalbe at variance with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, he ſhall alwaies be at ſure in the law, his marchandize ſhall be in hazard, and the manuring and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his grounds will be a great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:26781:62"/> paine and charge vnto him, he ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day haue new troubles in his minde, and the night which bringeth with it all the cares of the day forepaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, will toſſe vp and downe in his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie. And there is but one onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for all this, which is wholy to forſake the world: neither muſt he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his bodie onely from the world, but he muſt with a ſweet and an aſſured reſolution, ſeparate his minde cleane from the world, yea he muſt as it were, violently pluck away his very cogitations from it, and make them flie, haue nothing proper vnto himſelfe, keepe no company, he muſt be poore and without ſubſtance, and without all worldly dealings, farre from any negociations, ignorant of politike ſciences and trades, and onely prepare himſelfe to receiue into his ſoule, the inſtructions of holy wiſdom. And we cannot better prepare our ſelues herevnto, then to forget wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conditions, and naughtie dealing, wherein we were heretofore brought vp in and inſtructed, for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to write any thing vpon a written paire of tables, except we firſt wipe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:26781:62"/> that out which before was written; Euen ſo likewiſe it is impoſſible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue in the heart of men, the will and word of God, if ye firſt of all pluck not out thereof the fore conceiued opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which before haue beene therein imprinted by a wicked kinde of life. And hereunto the ſolitarie life is wonderfull profitable, becauſe that it ouercommeth all our perturbations, and giueth reaſon, time and leiſure, to draw them out of the ſoule. For as wilde beaſts are eaſily tamed when as they are made much of, and dealt gently withall; euen ſo our luſts, chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, terrors and ſorrowes, which are the very poiſons of our ſoules, are with greater eaſe ruled and gouerned by reaſon, when as they begin to quiet themſelues, and are not prouoked and made ſauage by a continuall cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore ſuch a place muſt be choſen out as this which we are in, out of all company, to the end our continuall meditation be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any reſort, for this godly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation nouriſheth the ſoule with ſweet and heauenly cogitations, and what a more bleſſed thing can there be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:26781:63"/> then to imitate here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth the life and accord of Angels? And to be vp by the ſunne riſing, to pray &amp; ſing himnes and ſongs vnto the creator, and when the ſunne is at the higheſt, to begin his labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> againe, and licor and ſeaſon his trauaile in the ſalt of deuout prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſpirituall ſongs? For there is nothing that ſo much gladdeth the minde, and maketh it more merie and ſtrong, then the conſolation of holy ſongs: and therefore quiet reſt is the very right preparatiue for the purging and clenſing of the ſoule. For, becauſe the tongue is not then impeached for the diſcouering of the affaires of the world, neither are the eyes yet occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied about the iudging of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diuerſity of colours, or of the proportion of bodies, neither doth the hearing ſpend and waſte the forces of the vnderſtanding, to heare pleaſant ſongs, which are made to tickle the cares, or yet matter of laughter, foolery and knauery, which ſerue for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe but to weaken the force and intention of the mind. Now when the ſoule is not caried away with thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of outward things, &amp; ſpred abroad
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:26781:63"/> as it were by the ſences vpon worldly things, ſhe commeth back vnto her ſelf and returneth wholy into her ſelfe, and afterward of her ſelfe raiſeth vp her ſelf euen vnto God. Then all the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and brightneſſe of this diuine moſt bright ſhining light, forgetteth all her naturall actions, &amp; careth no more for food and clothing, no ſhe not ſo much as once thinketh of any earthly thing, but tranſferreth all her ſtudy for the getting of eternall benefits. She addicteth her ſelfe, and ſtudieth how ſhe may become temperate, how ſhe may frame her actions according to righteouſneſſe and prudence, how ſhe may become couragious, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, all other vertues which deuout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons learne, to addreſſe al their actions vnto comlineſſe and perfection of life. The plaine beaten high way that muſt bring vs hereunto, and keepe vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of our duty, is the reading and meditating of the holy ſcriptures, for therein we ſhall finde the moſt vertuous and excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to cauſe vs to do well, that poſſiblie may be, and examples and hiſtories of the liues of holy and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:26781:64"/> religious perſons, which are ſo many liuely images, and exemplars of all good manners, and holy conuerſation, which are there ſet before vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Wherefore, whoſoeuer he be that ſhall feele any infirmitie in him ſelfe, and ſtaieth himſelfe hereon, ſhall finde therein as in a ritch and well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Apothecaries ſhop, euery ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie drugge that is fit to recouer his health, for let him that loueth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and modeſtie, read ouer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the hiſtorie of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and therein he ſhall learne actions full of great continencie and chaſtitie, and finde, that he was not onely chaſte and a reſiſter of filthie luſt, but by reaſon of long exerciſe, confirmed alſo in all ſorts of vertues, he ſhall likewiſe learne by <hi>Iob</hi> a rare couragious minde, in ſeeing the aduerſities which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, as being become from a great riche man, to be a moſt miſerable poore wretch, and from a father of a noble and great familie; a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and without children, ſtanding couragiouſlie and continually vnto his tackling, his mightie conſtancie being neuer abated, nor his heart any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:26781:64"/> whit at all leſſened. And when his friends which came to comfort him, had prouoked him, and fell a ieſting at him for his talke, and ſtirring his mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet could they neuer thereby driue him into choller. But if any man would dreame, with what magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie he could be able to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe courteous and gentle, and being angrie againſt ſinne, loue and make much of the perſons that offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he ſhall finde <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was a moſt braue and valiant expert man of warre, to be notwithſtanding ſuch a one, as was farre from reuenging himſelfe of his enemies. Such a one was alſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding he would be mightely angrie againſt thoſe that blaſphemed the honour of God: but vnto ſuch as offended and ſlaundered himſelfe, he would be merueilous calme and gentle. And therefore we muſt do as good Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Counterfeiters do, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon them to draw out the counterfeit of ſome man or beaſt, or any other thing elſe curiouſly wrought in a table before their faces, looking oftentimes vpon the thing which they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:26781:65"/> are counterfeiting, do draw the linia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one after another, vntill they haue finiſhed and ended their worke: that is to ſay, looking vpon the liues of holy men, as vpon liuely images, draw out of them the moſt excellent linia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vertue, to make vs perfect, and to make ours by imitation, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in all goodneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie. So we returning from labour vnto praiers, ſhall by them make our minds and ſpirits more liuely and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as heated and enflamed with a true godly loue. For a good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full praier engendreth in our ſoules, a manifeſt knowledge of the goodneſſe of God: for that maketh God, as it were, to dwell in vs, as hauing ſetled him deepely in our remembrances, and ſo by this means we are made the temples of God, when as the intent of our minde is not interrupted by any earthly cogitations, nor our ſoule troubled with any ſuddaine motions, but flying and eſchewing all other thing, retireth her ſelfe towards God as to her friend, and driuing away all peruerſe affections which mooue vs vnto intemperance, giueth her ſelfe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:26781:65"/> wholy vnto the ſtudie of thoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which lead her vnto vertue. And firſt it is very meet we take heed, that we ſpeake nothing impertinently to the purpoſe, but to finde out things after a gentle manner, and without contention, and to anſwer vnto that which is demaunded without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not interrupt him that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the purpoſe, of any thing, and to keepe ſuch a moderation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him, as that it might not ſeeme that he meant by any vaine oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to thwart the matter at that time ſet a broche. Neither muſt any man be aſhamed to learne, or yet hide that which hath beene taught him by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: dealing like vnto wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that robbe other women of their children, and make their husbands beleeue that they are theirs. But we muſt giue vnto him that hath taught vs, all the honour and glory. It is beſt, as I thinke, that euery man ſpeake moderately and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, ſo as his wordes be not loſt before they come vnto the eare, neither yet muſt they bee ouer lowde, nor raſhlie ſpoken, nor yet

He muſt firſt frame himſelfe to be of an humble and meeke ſpirit, that he might like and pleaſe him who hath need of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. The manner which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vſed in reproouing of <hi>Dauid,</hi> is very many times good and profitable for vs, who would not by and by, and vpon the ſudden, accuſe him of the foule fact which he had committed, but told him of his fault vnder the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of another, whereby he made him the iudge of his owne ſinne, ſo as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing condemned himſelfe, he could by no means take any occaſion to fall out with him that had reproued him. Now he that is humble and caſt downe in his cogitations, looketh alwaies down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, weareth his apparell careleſlie,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:26781:67"/> his haire long, and his garment not made after the faſhion, ſo as that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie that mourners faſhion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto, is naturall in him. His Gowne muſt be girt vnto him, but not aboue his loynes, for that is ſomewhat womaniſh: neither yet too looſe, for that bewrayeth his ſlothfulneſſe. His gate muſt not be ſlow; becauſe it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a ſoft ſpirit, ne yet ouer-haſtie, for feare he be noted to be haggar hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The garments are made but for one thing, which is, to keepe the fleſh from heat and cold. He muſt not hunt after colours, to pleaſe the eye, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit faſhions for delicacies ſake: for, they that hunt after theſe ſorts of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, are womaniſh, who beautify their ſmooth well coloured cheeks and their haire, with many ſtrange and diuers coloured paintings. The Gowne muſt be made of ſuch ſtuffe, as that we ſhall not need to caſt another vpon it, to kepe vs from the cold. His hoſing muſt be of a ſmall price, but yet of ſuch a price, as may ſuffice the neceſſitie for which he vſeth it. And generally, as in his garments, ſo muſt he alſo in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things haue regard vnto frugalitie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:26781:68"/> and profit. As for meate, bread will ſtaunch hunger, and water quench the thirſt of a ſound man. He may vſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads of herbs as farre as is neceſſarie to ſtrengthen and brawne the bodie. He muſt not at his meales eate raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly like an hunger ſtarued Wolfe, but ſhew himſelfe alwayes like vnto him ſelfe, ſober, and temperate in all his deſires: neither muſt he in the meane while occupie his minde in playing the foole, but dreaming of the nature of things wherewith we are nouriſhed, take occaſion to glorifie God, who gouerneth and moderateth all things, for ſo much as he hath deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and brought forth ſo many ſundry ſorts of meates, which by a ſingular propertie are applied vnto the vſe and maintenance of our bodyes. And therefore before we go to meate, we muſt geue God thanks for that which he hath beſtowed vpon vs, and beſeech him to beſtowe vppon vs in time to come, that which he hath promiſed vs. We muſt haue but one houre in the day for our meales, and that muſt be alſo obſerued in good order, ſo as in the xxiiij. houres of the day and night,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:26781:68"/> we muſt beſtow this one houre about our body, and all the reſt of the time muſt be ſpent in ſpirituall exerciſes. We muſt make but ſhort ſleepes, that we may wake quickly, and our ſleepe muſt be after the manner of our life, which is oftentimes interrupted by great and earneſt cogitations. For to be tyed to a deepe ſleepe, as if all our members were benummed, and by ſuch reſt to geue place vnto dreames, and fooliſh imaginations, is to dye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. Their morning, which make a deuout profeſſion, is midnight, for then do they take their time to prayſe God, becauſe that when as the reſt of the night turneth away their hearts from whatſoeuer might occupie their eyes &amp; eares, it keepeth their thoughts fixed on God, geueth them the means to amend their conſciences by recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their ſinnes, and to ſet barres vnto their ſoules to keepe them from euill, and to implore the goodnes of God, that it might worke together in them this perfection of life which they hope to aſpire and come vnto.</p>

Howbeit, if the Epiſtle of <hi>Saint Baſile</hi> which I haue put forth into French, haue done you any pleaſure, it is not to me that you ſhould ſhew the fauour: not vnto me, I ſay, who haue rather empared then amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the worke of ſo great a Clarke, in making it to change the toong, and to ſpeake out french language. Truly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Fathers of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there is not one amongſt them all that I better like of, then I like of him. Euery man hath his liking, and I will

Neuertheleſſe, there is one thing in your letter which you wrote vnto me that miſliketh me, and that is this, You write, that the often reading of this Epiſtle, which you ſay, you read ouer as it were euery day, hath brought you into a deſier to get you into ſome Monaſterie, and there to paſſe the reſt of your dayes, that you might turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your eyes from beholding the great miſeries which this miſerable ciuill warre hath hatched and brought foorth, and wholy conuert your mind and thoughts vnto the honor and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. This purpoſe of yours, I muſt needs confeſſe, proceedeth from a moſt godly hart, and a very good forecaſting meane to bring vnto you in your owne particular cauſe, ſome quietnes of mind, and peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I ſuppoſe to be one of the greateſt benefits which wee can any way locke for. But it would ſore grieue me to be bereaued of ſo ſweete and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26781:70"/> deere companie, and ſo great hurt vnto the common weale. You ſhould (beleeue me) in my poore opinion, doo maruellous wrong both vnto your countrey, and to your friends: and euery man is to ſeeke his owne benefit, but yet ſo, as that it be not to the hurt of another. For, wee are not borne heere in this world for our ſelues: and beſides, we are but the leſſer part of the whole, and therefore binde and tye your ſelfe vnto the great and principall parts thereof, with moſt ſtraight bonds, which allow vs not to withdrawe our ſelues in this dangerous ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without violating and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both the bonds of charitie, and alſo of godlyneſſe. And yet for all this, I would not haue you thinke, that I will gayneſay, or yet dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the commendation which <hi>Saint Baſile,</hi> and ſo many auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and my ſelfe with them, haue geuen vnto ſolitarie life: for I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend it, yea, and I loue it, it may be too well. But I wiſh you did loue it as they doo, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſelfe-ſame conſiderations,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26781:70"/> and not for any diſcouragement, the rather to auoyde the thwart and tedious dealings of a ciuile life, then for to followe the pleaſure that is in contemplation. Followe (if you pleaſe) the examples of the auncient Fathers, but followe them with that wiſedome and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they doo. Beleeue mee if you will, it is now no time for their example of life, to call ſuch men as you are, vnto ſolitarie life. For monaſticall life came not in, in a troubleſome time, ne yet for ſuch men, as whoſe wiſedome and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie was neceſſarie vnto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the weale publicke. Neyther doo wee ſee, that in the fyrſt beginning of the Chriſtian Church, although it was euerie manner of way, and with all ſorts of troubles and afflictions toſſed and turmoyled, that the Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe themſelues into the deſerts and ſolitarie places, there to ſerue God quietlie. But their liues beeing full of actions, and thoſe publicke alſo, hindered them to eſtabliſh the Churches, to diſcipline the people,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:26781:71"/> to conſerue the peace and vnion of cities and prouinces, and to ſerue for examples of modeſtie and temperance vnto the whole world. But when as the Chriſtians had full libertie and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that the Emperours and chiefe Gouernors had embraced the Religion, and kept the ſame vnder the couert of their armes and power, and fauored ſuch as made profeſſion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the peace then of it being eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the common weale being able as it were to be maintained of it ſelfe, vpon the good and ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſo many wiſe and holie perſonages had before layd, it was permitted vnto great learned men to enioy the ſweetneſſe of ſolitarie life. But of what age were they when they thus did? Forſooth it was euen then, when they had ſpent the ſtrength of their yong yeares in the gouernment of the ciuile life, and in worldly affaires amongſt men.

Put the caſe that a Father ſhould waxe mad, and be out of his wits, vppon whome would you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe the care, keeping, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of him? would you not ſay,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:26781:72"/> vppon the Children? Now, if the Children would excuſe them ſelues, and ſay, that hee had puniſhed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried, and beaten them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not take it vppon them, would you not finde fault with them, and with checks and taunts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to doo that dutie which both nature and charitie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them? Peraduenture you will ſay, that there are two things which withdrawe you, and they ſeeme to excuſe you for putting too your hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand, and medling in and with theſe affayres. And the one is, that it is loſt labor, that the pleadings of honeſt men are vtterlie vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and ſerue for none other purpoſe, but to make them to bee enuyed and hated, without brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any benefite to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale at all. By this, the wound is no whit the more cured, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie hath ouer-much wonne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon reaſon. For, honeſt men are no whit bound to trauell for the proffit and commoditie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, but ſo farre-foorth as theyr trauell may do good, and that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:26781:73"/> there is thereby ſome hope of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For, men muſt deale in a State, as Phiſitions do with their phiſicke, for, they muſt not miniſter phiſicke vnto diſeaſes that are incurable, which bringeth nothing elſe vnto themſelues but ſhame and diſhonor. The other that you tell of, is this, that there are ſome things which an honeſt man may not by any meanes poſſible ſupport, nor diſſemble. Well, patience is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous great vertue, and greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming, and neceſſary for the life of men, and yet ſhe hath her bounders, and the miſchiefe groweth ſometimes vnto ſuch an head, as that they which both loue and feare God, are no way able to abide it. For anſwere vnto the firſt, this I ſay, that it is a cowardly, idle, and ſlothfull excuſe, grounded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon our puſillanimitie, then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon wiſedome which it ſo vaunteth of. For, who is he that can haue any iuſt occaſion to deſpaire of the good of an Eſtate or of a Citie, ſince we ſee by the courſe of hiſtories how vncertaine, both their ruine and preſeruation is? For, how often haue we ſeene king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp; cities fall, euen in their moſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:26781:73"/> flouriſhing time, by a ſuddaine earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and by great winds; and other ſome, altogether tottering, and almoſt halfe fallen, maruelouſly holden vp, rayſed, and ſet vp againe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of their ruines? For, this power of God, which men foreſee not, hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to hang betweene feare and hope, neither was there euer any thing ſo ſure, as that the fall of it was not to be feared, nor any thing ſo ſtaggering, as that there was not ſome hope of the ſtaying thereof. And this is without all doubt moſt true, that if our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay wholy in our owne hands, we had alreadie bene damned. Howbeit, God fighteth for vs againſt our ſelues, and will ſaue vs whether we will or no. Now, although we were ſure to be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſawe it neuer ſo clearely, that it would light vpon vs, as in verie deed we ſee not ſo much as one iote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is it not a part of the dutie of good children and good friends, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What is it then that you would haue? Would you ſee all things as they ſhould be, as to ſee good men in authoritie, ill men ſuppreſt by lawes, and Iuſtice to rule and reigne? Surely, theſe are worthy wiſhes of you, and worthie an honeſt man; howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the world is not gouerned by wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and woulding. A man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſier good things, but let them be as they may, we muſt needes beare them. There will be vices ynow in the world, ſo long as there are men in the world. And this is to heale and eaſe theſe diſorders whereunto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale and your dutie call you, neither muſt you bring with you, your eyes alone, but your hands alſo, to heale your countrey of ſo grieuous wounds.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:26781:74"/> not the matter, but is geuen vnto vs: for, a good workman, is oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to worke in a rotten peece of wood, and yet for all that he muſt not geue it ouer, but make the beſt he can of ſuch an ilfauoured peece of wood. When <hi>Solon</hi> was asked whether he had geuen vnto the <hi>Athenians</hi> the beſt lawes he could, he anſwered no, but I haue geuen them the beſt that they are able to abide. And we muſt apply remedies according to the ſtrength &amp; nature of the diſeaſed. To be ſhort, we are not warranted in our affaires none otherwiſe then with our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and hauing done the beſt we can, becauſe it is to be done, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diſcharged both before God &amp; men. And as for the particular iniuries which we receiue therby, where ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we better beſtow our charitie &amp; patience? where ſhall we exerciſe that which we learne out of the ſchoole of Chriſt, if we can not beare the iniuries &amp; ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people with whome wee liue? yea, when ſhall we hope that by our patience wee ſhall appeaſe the popular furies, bring agayne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people into their right wits,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:26781:75"/> diſplace the wicked from their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and ſet good men in their rooms? It is moſt certaine, that theſe diſeaſes are ſooner cured by winning of time, then by applying of remedies, it is far better to entertaine them by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they empaire not, for in the end, it is length of time that muſt ripen and heale them. For, the people by experience recouer health, and then they ſeeke after good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, and abhorre thoſe whome before they had made much of. They are like vnto pale-coulored maydes, which eate all the worſt things that poſſibly they can get, but they caſt them by and by vp againe. For, ſo ſoone as they are ſtirred and moued, they vſe for the ſeruing of their turne the moſt deſperate and moſt wicked men: but they are no ſooner quieted and in a good moode, and that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate boyling heate hath runne ouer, they by and by make no accompt of thoſe villaines, but are the firſt that will lay hold on them and plague them.

If loue, which God hath ſo highly commended vnto vs, may ſo preuaile with vs, as to hazard our goods and liues for the ſafetie of our neighbour, what ought we to do for ſuch an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable number of men, and ſuch a number of cities and prouinces, vnto which nature hath conioyned and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed vs by all one lawe, language, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſecret affection, which ſhe hath imprinted in vs, from the which, whoſoeuer ſeparateth himſelfe, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged of all the nations of the world vnworthie to behold the day light, and to liue and be eſteemed amongſt men as an vnnaturall and cruell Parricide.

I haue deſired nothing in the world, but to ſee thy face, I meane not, O Lord, thy diuine face, wherein is

Sith then, O Lord, if thou be that increated word which hath created al things which doth part of thy will, and thy will, a part of thy ſelfe, doth it not repreſent it ſelfe vnto me, as thy face, for me to note &amp; marke therein, ſuch a great number of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and excellent lineaments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, which ſhine moſt brightly in euery part thereof? O Lord, I am in loue with this rare beautie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue I any other care &amp; thought, but that I may enioy this thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which offreth it ſelfe vnto me in thy word, as in a looking glaſſe of thy Deitie.</p>

And although my ſinnes which are moſt foule and filthie make thee to be diſpleaſed with me, yet I moſt humbly beſeech thee, not to be angry with me, neither turne thou away this thy faire and wonderfull face from me. For, thou O Lord, art angry with none, but with ſuch as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in their ſinnes, and ſtubburnely perſiſt in their iniquities.

And therfore thou art not to reiect me: for, if thou ſhouldeſt, thou muſt alſo therewith reiect thy mercie whereunto I am coupled, and ſo faſt linked, as that as it cannot be ſeperated from thee, ſo is it alſo now faſt linked vnto my repentance.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 And therefore thou ſhouldeſt, if it might ſo pleaſe thee, dwell and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne with me, and ſeeing it hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thee to allow me for thy ſeruant, and to thruſt me into this combat, thou art not to leaue and forſake me

And therefore, O Lord, I beſeech thee to help me euermore. For, as mine infirmitie ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth commonly againſt me, ſo alſo haue I need to haue continuall help on euery ſide of me. For, if thou keepe thy ſelfe neuer ſo little awhile from me, my ſoule will euen vaniſh away, and ſo will alſo my bodie, if my ſoule be once gone. For thou, O Lord, art farre away more, the ſoule of my ſoule, then my ſoule, is the ſoule of my bodie. I right well knowe that thy Diuine Maieſtie hath a moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie dwelling place in mee, but yet I humblie beſeech thee, diſdaine not to come into it: for, where thou once entreſt, all magnificence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, and there is alwayes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſufficient where thou art. And beſides, O Lord, thou receyueſt no honor by comming to viſit me, but I thy poore ſeruant am honored by thy preſence. Why ſhouldeſt thou leaue the glorious bright Heauens, and bright ſhining Starres, and to

But it is, as I thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wouldeſt haue thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles knowe and vnderſtand, that they ought not to pride vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in theyr magnificence, ſeeing they are thy creatures, and that thou canſt make the moſt vile enhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on the earth, as honorable as any one of them. This is it why thou commeſt downe from the heauen of heauens, to haue mercie vppon vs, and hauing the like feeling of our miſeries, thou commeſt to reeſtabliſh vs in our auncient perfection. And becauſe that wee, as much as in vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, haue defaced the image of the Deitie, which thou haddeſt imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vs, thou commeſt to recharge and recouer the liniaments of our firſt nature halfe defaced. It is thou then, who as thou waſt our Creator, ſo alſo wilt be our Redeemer, and, as thou haſt beene our Father, ſo alſo wilt be our protector and defender. And it is thou, O Lord, who, although the whole world hath reiected vs, yet haſt ſtretched out thine armes, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:26781:129"/> gathered vs together vnder the wing of thy louing kindneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 And ſo is it moſt meet, for I knowe not whither elſe to goe. My Father and my Mother haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee, I meane, the Father that begot mee, and my Mother that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly nurſed me, and brought me vp, did abhorre mee, when as they ſawe mee ſet my whole hart vpon thee, and leaue the vanities of this world.

                     <p n="17">17 Now, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee, thus to enlarge thy grace towards me, that I might be conſerued, teach me, I beſeech thee, how I may ſerue thee: Learne me what thy law is, and how I muſt direct my ſteps, that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually walke a right in that narrow and thornie path, which muſt conduct me vnto the port of ſaluation. For, it is long ſithence, O Lord, that I left that broad and eaſie way, ſowed with the pleaſures of this world, and which bringeth all thoſe that follow the ſame, vnto deſtruction &amp; damnation. Shew me therefore, my God, thy way, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a guide, I can neuer ſtray, ſhew it me, O Lord, I ſay, for if I go ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little out of it, I am vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, mine enemies lie in waite to ſurpriſe me, and to make me ſubiect, to diſhonour me, and ſo conſequently, thy ſelfe, O Lord, becauſe they know that I ſerue thee faithfully.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 Deliuer me not therefore into their hands, that they may deale with me according to their hearts deſire.

Or, ſhall I ſpeake but of that incredible loue, by which thou haſt deliuered thine owne only Sonne vnto death, to purchaſe for vs life euerlaſting? I have not breath inough ô Lord for ſuch an enterpriſe, but let it content thee, that I ſanctifie thy name with an humble and chaſt thought, and that my meditation be alwayes fixed vppon all the benefits wherwith it pleaſeth thee continually to fauour me, ſo as both my ſelfe, and as many as thou haſt placed here in this world, as in the middeſt of a ritch Temple, for the beholding and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on euery ſide the excellency of thy Deitie, we neuer turne our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings vnto any other thing, but to the comprehending and learning of

A moſt bleſſed and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reigne: for, to obey thee, is to commaund our vnruly appetites, and to command them, is, for a man to be maſter of his owne ſelfe, and for a man to be maſter of him ſelfe, is the moſt ſouereigne principalitie. It is an eaſy matter, my God, to obey thee, thy yoke is gratious, and the tribute which thou exacteſt on vs, is nothing elſe, but to haue vs to be bleſſed.

O, the pride of thy magnificent Palaces is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. Now, all thy ſumptuous and ritch ſhewes of thy coſtly buildings are come downe, and brought to rubbiſh. I looked on euery ſide of mee, to ſee what was become of all the braue men, which were woont to furniſh thy houſes, but I ſawe all lye lyke a waſte wilderneſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:26781:193"/>
                     <p>I ſought in euery place, and could finde nothing, there was no bodie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me, and yet I called all the towne ouer. I ſaw nothing come out of thy Caſtles but iack dawes &amp; owles. And now ô poore Citie, which ſometime wert the ſtately dwelling place of Kings, and the Princeſſe of Prouinces, and the feate of the kingdome, thine honor is dead, and thou art become a moſt miſerable widow. Sorow is now thy liuery and badge, ſorrow, without end, ſorrow, full of all horror, yea and ſorrow, full of all deſpaire. For, alaſſe, thou ſaweſt not only thy goods and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loſt, but being loſt, thou ſaweſt them alſo put vnto moſt cruell paine and torment. With what eyes ſhall they be euer able to looke towards thee, and with what thoughts be able to remember thee, when as groaning vnder the burden of a moſt inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſlauery, they ſhall repreſent vnto thee, thine auncient magnificence, and their priſtinate libertie? will they not all ſay weeping, that the Princeſſe of the nations is now become a moſt wretched ſlaue, and ſhe that was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to commaund others, is become
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:26781:193"/> her ſelfe now to be taxed? O poore and miſerable Citie, thou haſt now maruellouſly altered thine eſtate and condition. Weepe therefore, and ſigh hardly, for, neither thy weeping, nor yet thy ſighing, will theſe many dayes be able to match thy miſeries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Beth.</label> She wept and wept againe, and her eyes neuer ceaſed. And when the Sunne aroſe to take his courſe, ſhe began to mourne, and when he went downe, yet had ſhe neuer made an end. All liuing creatures withdrew them ſelues into dolefull and darke places, and all things were ſilent and at reſt euery where: but her plaints encreaſed in the darke, and the nights reſt was troubled with her cryes. Her broken and trembling voyce ſounded euery where, and all the whole world that heard this complayning voyce, were moued with horror and feare. Her cheekes were neuer dry, and her teares neuer ceaſed running. Her face was euer wet, and her eyes diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led continually. And alaſſe, how could her plaints end, when as there was no end of her miſerie? She had not one onely to comfort her, no not ſo much
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:26781:194"/> as one to wipe away her teares. All her friends forſooke her, and the neereſt neighbours ſhe had, quite and cleane left her. They that ſometimes honored her good hap, do now vtterly contemne her, and they that once reuerenced her proſperitie, do now ſcorne and mocke her: for, ſome of them fled from her when ſhe fell into miſerie, and they that tarried behinde, did nothing elſe but diſhonor her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Gimel.</label> Thus was poore <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the poore <hi>Hebrewes</hi> entreated and handled in their captiuitie. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſſe, followed ſhame, and after domage rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>och. They went this way and that way, thinking to find ſome that would comfort them, but all the world purſued them. And what, the very dens of the wilde beaſts were their ſafetie, when any went about to ſet vppon them, and the poore people could neyther finde caue, nor any place of repaire, ſafely to go into. The nature of miſerie is to haue compaſſion on others, but the miſerie of this people, encreaſed the hatred that was borne them. In ſo much as that nature it ſelfe is here
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:26781:194"/> altered, to the end to augment the torment of theſe poore people.</p>
                     <p>Alaſſe, what a fatall ruyne is this, that can not be auoyded? For, thus they might haue ſayd: If ſo be ye will haue our goods, ye ſhall haue them: if ſo be it be for our lands &amp; houſes that ye afflict vs, why, take them to you, and if yee perſecute vs for hatred that yee beare vnto the name of our Countrey, why, wee will baniſh our ſelues thence. What would our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie haue more of vs? Why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth it vs when as wee are readie to flye? Doth it afflict vs that are poore wretches? and purſue vs who are baniſhed? Wee are ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade through out all the nations of the world, and ſtray and fleete about like wracks and vagabonds, we haue all the miſeries that any can poſſibly beare, and yet haue not ſo much as one of the leaſt of their comforts. And they that ſee vs, are voyde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, neyther do they looke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vncompaſſionately vppon vs, but ſcornefully alſo. And this was not our entertayneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in one place alone, but euery where: and the onely benefit
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:26781:195"/> which we haue, is this, that all things are alike vnto vs in our miſerie. For, perſecution paſſeth as lightly away as we, and is preſent euery where with vs. For, if we thinke to eſcape by any vnknowne and ſecret place, we ſhall finde ſome thing to bewray vs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs vnto our enemies. Ha, what a thing is this? muſt we who are chaſed into all the corners of the earth, thinke to returne and hide our ſelues vnder the ruynes of our houſes, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue continually our griefes, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hideous deſolation of our Citie?</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Daleth.</label> O poore <hi>Syon,</hi> wee ſhould then be enforced to behold thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with far more teares &amp; grones, we ſhould looke vpon the great beaten hye wayes, and ſay vnto our ſelues, What is become of all thoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that were wont to couer all theſe hye wayes, and where are they that were wont to come by heapes, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor our Citie? For, all the nations both whole and ſome, haue come running vnto our feaſts, and to the ſolemnities of our great ſacrifices: but now, we ſee not ſo much as a man once come neere
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:26781:195"/> vnto this holy Citie. There is not ſo much as an hermitage about it. All the wayes are couered ouer with graſſe, and there is a pretie foreſt of briers &amp; thiſtles about it. Neither can one finde and pick out the footſtep of any man. Theſe beautifull and great gates ſo ritchly &amp; cunningly wrought, which in the ſolemne dayes were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with garlands and noſegayes, are now layd all wide open vpon the ground, and broken in fitters. The Centres that layd open the wayes, are now filled and ſtopped vp with their ruynes: Alaſſe, what a change is this? And the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of our Prieſts which went in their <hi>pontificalibus,</hi> ſinging with great maieſtie &amp; reuerence the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our God, are torne and rent in pieces as well as other mens, and do nothing elſe but weepe and groane. They looke vp pitifully with their eyes vnto heauen, to ſee whether the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his wrath would fall vpon them yea or no. The tender Virgines who were wont with their beauty to adorne the face of our City, as the Starres do a moſt glorious and cleare night, are all withered and beſmeared, and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:26781:196"/> nothing but horror and aſtoniſhment in their countenances. For, extreame famine hath dried vp their fleſh, cold hath bereaued them their ruddy and ſmooth cheekes, ſorrow and griefe hath wrinkeled their faces, and the flower of their chaſtitie by the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier inſolently defaced, hath couered all their faces with ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. And theſe are now no more, but euen ſo many dead, liuing. For, they liue altogether in ſorrow and griefe. Neither is there any thing that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth them more to liue, then the ſame dolor, which killeth them with very heauineſſe, and awakeneth them out of their bitterneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>He.</label> A dolor truly, too too bitter, and in very deede more bitter then ſoote, to ſee them-ſelues carried in triumph by their greateſt enemies, to ſee them braue by our ſpoyles, ritch, by our great pouertie, and mightie by our ouerthrow. Thou haſt, ô Lord, poured out thy heauie wrath vppon vs, and madeſt vs feele how heauie thy reuengefull hand is. Thou haſt, I beleeue, gathered together all our faults into a bundell once for all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:26781:196"/> that when thou ſaweſt them to be ſo infinite, and worthie the like payne and puniſhment, thou awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt thy ſelfe, and haſt diſcharged the arrowes of thy ſeuere iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. But, ô Lord, oughteſt not thou to ſtay the courſe of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our owne perſons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all thy torments vpon vs? but muſt we alſo be tormented in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our children, and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our miſerie the greater, to cauſe vs alſo to ſee theirs? For, wee were ſpoyled of our goods, put out of our houſes, and led away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. Wee thought that there was nothing, as it were, to bee feared more then death, and yet now wee feare it not, for, it is ſweet to thoſe that are in miſerie. But our ſpeedie and quicke calamitie, to our great payne and griefe, hath now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken vs with newe miſeries. For, wee haue ſeene goe before vs whole bands of our children fettered, and carried captiue into Babylon, there to ſerue our enemyes as bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues.</p>

                     <p>
                        <label>Vau.</label> Euen ſo hath <hi>Syon</hi> loſt the flower of her youth, and all the honor of her City is cleane gone: She hath bene miſerably torne all to rags, and there is no whole thing left in her, but ſorrow &amp; griefe. For, the greateſt and ritcheſt of her inhabitants were caried away by troupes, and led into ſtrange Prouinces, as flocks of ſheepe are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by dayes iourneys from market to market, without geuing them any leaue to feed as they go. They go with their heads and their eyes looking downe to the ground, ſighing moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly. And the conqueror followeth them ſcourging them with rods, and they which dwell by the hye wayes ſides, as they paſſe, laugh at their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and moſt iniuriouſly cry out vpon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Zain.</label> And as a freſh wound openeth againe the old ones, euen ſo were their harts throughly pierced, whereby they remembred their old ſinnes, and the puniſhment which their fathers ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe they had forſaken the true ſeruice of God, and geuen them ſelues ouer vnto their fooliſh paſſions. They called alſo to mind, how often
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:26781:197"/> they were fallen into their enemies hands when as God had left them. O, thou too too ouer late remembrance, thou ſhouldeſt haue come a great deale ſooner, to haue turned them from their wicked and abhominable wayes, and if they would not haue done it for Gods ſake, yet they ſhould haue done it at leaſt for feare of his fury which they had ſo often felt. O late repentance, which commeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment ſuffred. They were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poreblind that could not foreſee this great trayne of miſeries which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their offences.

For, a man ſhall at laſt, finde alwayes pitie and compaſſion in him, if ſo be he will patiently attend his good pleaſure and leyſure. The Sunne neither riſeth nor falleth, but it ſeeth his mercy. His goodnes ſpreddeth it ſelfe ouer all the earth, neyther is there any corner thereof which beareth not his marke. And furthermore, I ſay, that the Sunne ſhineth not but to be ſeene, and to cauſe to ſee. O Lord our God, how great is thy goodnes, how aſſured is thine ayd, how certaine is thy word, and how infallible, thy promiſe? As for my ſelfe, I wil truſt in none but in thee, and if ſo be I may haue thy grace and fauour for my portion, I care for none of the reſt. My ſoule is fully reſolued hereof, and do feele it ſay vnto my conſcience, that ſhe putteth all her truſt in thee, and layeth vp her ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:26781:219"/> in thy hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Thet.</label> How can ſhe do better? For, God neuer halted with them which put their truſt in him, for at one time or another, either early or late he hath ſhewed them, that his goodnes is infallible, and that the hart which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, findeth it farre or neere, and that the ſoule which deſireth it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in either ſoone or late. We muſt therefore wayt for it patiently, and not murmure if God come not vnto vs at the firſt call, let vs hold our peace, and let him do it, and he will in the end do that which ſhe ſhall ſee to be moſt for his glory, &amp; moſt neceſſary for our ſaluation. For, great things are not brought to paſſe, nor made perfect but with patience and long ſuffering. And let vs not deſpaire, if ſo be things fall not out as we would wiſh at the firſt chop. For, he doth nothing but for our good, for, as he is Almightie, ſo is he alſo only good, and as he is only good, ſo is he alſo only wiſe: and that, which we thinke many times to be moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, is moſt profitable for vs, and the wholeſomeſt medecines, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt bitter. Beleeue me, it is a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:26781:219"/> good thing for a man a little to beare the yoke in his youth, that is to ſay, to haue afflictions which may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bow and bend his neck, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his pride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Iod.</label> Let a wiſe man therefore which feeth him ſelfe fallen into any great calamitie, be quiet and ſay nothing, but patiently beare his yoke, and the more that his miſerie encreaſeth, let him be the more couragious, and yet neuertheleſſe, let him lift vp his eyes vnto heauen, and cry God mercy, and imagine thus with him ſelfe, that it can not be but that he hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, ſeeing that the hand of God doth ſo viſit him. Let him proſtrate him ſelfe vpon the ground, and clothe him ſelfe with ſacke, and caſt aſhes on his head, to ſee if he can any way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of God, and although he hath no hope thereof, yet let him quiet him ſelfe, and let him patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare the iniuries that are done him, offer his cheeke to him that will ſtrike him, and ſatisfie him ſelfe as well with reproch, as another man would fill him ſelfe with bread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Coph.</label> And why ſo? forſooth becauſe
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:26781:220"/> he right well knoweth, that God will in the end appeaſe his wrath, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that men ſhall haue driuen him to the ground, that God will take him vp in his lap, and although he let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for once, yet will he in the end haue compaſſion vpon him, according to the greatnes and multitude of his mercies. For, God taketh no pleaſure in ſeeing men afflicted, and it is much againſt his heart to torment them, yea euen when his iuſtice enforceth and ſtrayneth him thereto. And he doth it for the benefit of men, becauſe he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that his ouer-great indulgence, will caſt them downe ſo headlong into ſinne, as that they ſhall neuer be able to recouer them ſelues any more. For, he correcteth them as a good father doth, who in chaſtiſing his ſonne, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with griefe that he driueth him thereunto, not meaning thereby to do him any hurt, but rather good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Lamed.</label> It is not, beleeue me, the purpoſe of God, to tread men vnder his feet, and to triumph ouer them in their afflictions, much leſſe to hold them faſt bound and poſternd as the trophees of his power. Neither is it his
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:26781:220"/> meaning to throw them into miſerie &amp; pouertie, and there to leaue them, for he knoweth beſt what they haue need of, and iudgeth aright what is moſt profitable for them. He is nothing like vnto thoſe wicked Iudges, which take pleaſure in nothing but in cuffing and boxing of men, and to haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to hang and torture them vpon the wheele. He neuer beholdeth our ſinnes but with ſorrow of heart, neither hateth he any thing ſo much, as to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. And ſo, all the calamities which he layeth vpon vs, are but as threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning words to aduertiſe vs to runne vnto his grace, before he enter into iudgement with vs, to the end that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne vs, we might plead the pardon and remiſſion of our ſins which he ſhall haue graunted vs.</p>

Let our hearts lift vp them

               <p n="7">7 The terror, ô Lord, of thy great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty maketh me afeard to ſpeake: &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I feele my miſery to preſſe me and purſue me, &amp; that I know my helpe is in thee, yet dare I not addreſſe my praier vnto thee. But I am like vnto the young new hatched ſwallow, who being naked and without feathers, is left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the neſt, pittifully chirping and looking for her dam. Nay, I am rather like vnto the ſcarefull Doue alone in her neſt, who ſeeing the Gerfalcon ſoaring ouer her head, hideth her ſelfe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:26781:240"/> poore miſerable Doue, &amp; ſitteth cloſe and amazed, by reaſon of the danger ſhe ſeeth her ſelf in. O my God, I know my miſery, &amp; do right well vnderſtand mine infirmity. But although ô Lord, that with a ſubmiſſe voice &amp; trembling words, I implore thy maieſty, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me not I humbly beſeech thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Is it ſo long ſithence, ô Lord, that I turned mine eies vnto thee, to call vpon thy goodneſſe. I am alwaies won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lift vp mine eyes on hie. O Lord, I am at a non plus, I am forced, and my miſery is gone ouer mine head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore I beſeech thee to helpe me, if it may ſo pleaſe thee.</p>
               <p n="9">9 But alas, dare I ſpeake vnto God, and ſhew my ſelfe vnto him? Euen I, whom he hath created with his owne hands, and faſhioned by his grace, who in ſtead of ſeruing and honouring of him, haue giuen my ſelfe vnto the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, and turned the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which I owe vnto him, vnto earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and corruptible things? what anſwer will he make me? for if he grow once to be angry, and ſhew himſelfe vnto me in his fury, with that countenance that he ſhall iudge the guilty, were it not an

               <p n="10">10 I will endeuour my ſelfe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe him before, in preſenting him for an offring, the contrition of mine heart, and bitterneſſe of my ſoule, and in my greeuous anguiſh, will call to minde all my yeares paſt, lay abroade the moments of life, runne ouer the number of my ſinnes, that I might cleanſe and purge the ſinnes and tranſgreſſions, which defile my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſtirre vp Gods wrath againſt me.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And therfore thou ſhalt, ô Lord, moſt aſſuredly, ſeeing that I returne vnto thee, and bitterly weepe for mine offences, receiue my repentance, and through the heartineſſe of my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall prayers which I ſo effectuouſly powre out vnto thee, appeaſe thy ſharpe and heauy wrath. Thou ſhalt ſtay the hand of thy iuſtice, which would ſwallow me vp. Thou ſhalt turne away the dart of death, whoſe point
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:26781:241"/> hath pierced me euen to the very hart. Thou ſhalt lengthen the courſe of my yeares, which my ſinne hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhortened. And thou ſhalt bee contented that thou haſt reprooued me without vtterly vndoing me, and made me to acknowledge and confeſſe my ſinnes, with puniſhing me for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And although I thinke my ſelfe bleſſed, and as it were, in moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent peace, yet do I vſe, nay rather abuſe the bleſſings and riches, which thou haſt lent and vouchſafed mee: yea, and although, I ſay, I ſhould be drunken with the hony ſweet pleaſures of this world, yet loe a ſtore of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and miſery is betide me, which as a moſt bitter brooks, is come vpon me to drowne me and ſwallow me vp. But as I was about to giue vp the ghoſt, I felt thee taking me by the hand, and by a wonderfull helpe, dreweſt me by little and little out of that fearefull gulfe. O Lorde, the weight that ſunke me to the bottome, was the waight of my ſinnes. They lay ſo thick and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie on my head, and held me ſo to the ground, as that I knew not how
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:26781:242"/> to lift vp mine eyes vnto heauen, much leſſe was I able to hold vp my head, and open my mouth, to vtter and ſhew forth thy holy grace and mercy. Thou haſt broken the chaines of the wicked affections, which held me bound vnto theſe curſed ſinnes. And neuertheleſſe, becauſe they are euer before thine eyes, and that my repentance in ſome meaſure coniureth thy goodneſſe, and mine iniquity ſharpeneth thy iuſtice, yet haſt thou caſt all mine offences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thy back, and turned them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thy preſence, to the end, there might be nothing betweene me and thy mercy, to hinder me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enuironed by the ſame, as mine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and aſſured defence. But how can this be ô Lord, that thou, who ſeeſt all things both preſent &amp; to come, which ſeeſt through the earth, and pierceſt the bottomes of our hearts, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of me alone, ô Lord, thou becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt blinde, and ſeeſt not my ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:26781:242"/> that which thou kneweſt, before ſuch time as it was done.</p>
               <p n="13">13 From whence, ô Lord, commeth this great change and alteration in thee? whence commeth it, that to do me fauour, thou putteſt ſo farre from thee, thy iuſtice which is naturally in thee? I wonder, but yet cannot I tell from whence this thy ſo great cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and louing kindneſſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. It is, yea it is, ô Lord, becauſe thou wilt ſaue vs whether we wil or no, and to draw vs as it were by force, out of that condemnation which we moſt iuſtly haue deſerued. For, thou art the God of glory, iealous of honour and praiſe, for thou art alone worthy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thou knoweſt right well that very hell ſhall praiſe thee, and thou knoweſt alſo, ô Lord, that death it ſelfe, ſhall ſet forth thy praiſe. Seeing that thou haſt created all things, to teſtifie thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe and power, ſhall death which is one of thy works, make an end of thy praiſe? Yea, and ſeeing thou haſt here placed man, to lift vp his eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, and to behold thy glory, and to ſing both with the heart and mouth, a continuall hymne therof, and if thou
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:26781:243"/> take away his life, is not that a breache of one of the organes of thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? And if thou ſend him to hell, is not that to defame thy workmanſhip? Thou haſt, ô Lord, ſowne by the mouthes of thy Prophets, the truth of thy promiſes. Shall they that are pent vp in the earth gather together the fruite thereof: ſhall they whome the death of the body hath cloſed vp the eye liddes, and whome the death of the ſoule, engendred through their impenitence, hath ſealed vp the eyes of the ſpirit, making them go groping to hell, wandring and ſtumbling from paine to paine, and from torment to torment? No, no, it ſhall be the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man that ſhall publiſh and ſet forth thy praiſe, the man, I ſay, that liueth, and that liuing life which is maintained by thoſe bleſſings which thou beſtoweſt vpon vs here on the earth, and that life which is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the beholding of thy Deitie, and by the bleſſings which thou haſt laide vppe in heauen. Euen ſo, O Lorde, do I at this day with them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath pleaſed thee to conuert my miſeries into grace and bleſſing, and
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:26781:243"/> to turne away from me death and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors which brought them vnto mee. Mine infirmitie is at this day, ſeeing it ſo pleaſeth thee, an argument of thy glory, &amp; thou workeſt ſuch miracles in me as are able to aſtoniſh an whole world. To the end, ô Lord, that the fathers may tell vnto their children, what the effects of thy mercies are, how ſure the effect of thy promiſes, and how vndoubted, the truth of thy word. And ſo whenſoeuer the laſt and hindermoſt poſteritie, ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what hath be fallen vnto my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it will praiſe and bleſſe thy holy name.</p>
